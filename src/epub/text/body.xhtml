
<h2>JESTING PILATE</h2>
<h2>PORT SAID</h2>
<p>The after-hatch was off. Hung high above the
opening, the electric lights glared down into
the deep square well of the hold. The watcher,
leaning over the brink of the well, shouted and
waved his arms. The donkey-engine rattled responsively.
Twenty sacks of potatoes came rushing
up from the depths. Ten feet above the level
of the deck, they were swung sideways by the transverse
pull of a second rope, hung suspended for a
moment beyond the gunwale, then, at another signal
from the watcher, dropped down into the waiting
lighter. The watcher raised his hand again;
again the engine rattled. Two empty loops of rope
came up over the ship’s side, whipped across the
deck and went down, writhing like living snakes,
into the well. At the bottom, far down, little men
caught at the trailing ropes, piled up the sacks,
made fast. The watcher shouted. Yet another
quintal of potatoes came rushing up, swung sideways,
dropped out of sight over the edge of the
ship. And so it continued, all the night. Curiously,
admiringly, and at last with a growing sense
of horror, I looked on. Moving bits of matter from
one point of the world’s surface to another—man’s
whole activity. And the wisdom of the East, I
reflected, consists in the affirmation that it is better
to leave the bits of matter where they are. Up to
a point, no doubt, the sages of the East are right.
There are many bits of matter which might be
left in their place and nobody would be any the
worse. These particles of ink, for example, which
I so laboriously transfer from their bottle to the
surface of the paper.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We landed—in what a sink! At Port Said they
speak all languages, accept every currency. But
their exchange is robbery and they employ their
gift of tongues only for cheating. The staple industry
of the place seems to be the manufacture
and sale of indecent photographs. They are
stocked in almost every shop; they are pressed
upon you—at prices that decline astonishingly, as
you walk away, from a sovereign to half a crown—by
every loafer. The copiousness of the supply is
proof of a correspondingly large demand for these
wares by passing travellers. In these matters, it
seems, many people are more agreeably excited by
the representation—whether pictorial or verbal—than
by carnal reality. It is a curious psychological
fact, for which I can find no complete
explanation.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IN THE RED SEA</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Talking with Europeans who live and work
in the East, I find that, if they love the East
(which they mostly do), it is always for the same
reason. In the East, they say, a man is somebody;
he has authority and is looked up to; he knows all
the people who matter and is known. At home, he
is lost in the crowd, he does not count, he is nobody.
Life in the East satisfies the profoundest
and most powerful of all the instincts—that of
self-assertion. The young man who goes out from a
London suburb to take up a clerkship in India
finds himself a member of a small ruling community;
he has slavish servants to order about,
dark-skinned subordinates to whom it is right and
proper to be rude. Three hundred and twenty
million Indians surround him; he feels incomparably
superior to them all, from the coolie to the
maharaja, from the untouchable to the thoroughbred
Brahmin, from the illiterate peasant to the
holder of half a dozen European degrees. He may
be ill-bred, stupid, uneducated; no matter. His
skin is white. Superiority in India is a question
of epiderms. No wonder if he loves the East.
For the European, Eastern conditions of life are
a kind of intoxicant. But the tipsiness they produce
is more satisfactory than that which results
from the absorption of whisky. Alcohol, as the
anonymous poet has said:</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>Bids valour burgeon in strong men,</p>
<p class='line'>Quickens the poet’s wit and pen,</p>
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Despises fate.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>But the sense of power which it gives, the feeling
of grandeur and importance, are purely illusory
and do not last. The intoxication of the East is
permanent, and the sense of greatness is not entirely
an illusion. The commercial traveller who
goes East is really a greater man (so long as he
remains in the East) than his colleague in patent
medicines at home. Sobriety supervenes only when
he returns to Europe. In the West he finds his
natural place in the social hierarchy. One out of
London’s suburban millions, he feels homesick for
the East. It is not to be wondered at. What man
likes to be sediment, when he might float gallantly
on the sunlit surface?</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>AT SEA</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody in the ship menaces us with the
prospect of a very “good time” in India. A
good time means going to the races, playing bridge,
drinking cocktails, dancing till four in the morning,
and talking about nothing. And meanwhile
the beautiful, the incredible world in which we
live awaits our exploration, and life is short, and
time flows stanchlessly, like blood from a mortal
wound. And there is all knowledge, all art. There
are men and women, the innumerable living, and,
in books, the souls of those dead who deserved to
be immortal. Heaven preserve me, in such a
world, from having a Good Time! Heaven helps
those who help themselves. I shall see to it that
my time in India is as bad as I can make it.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BOMBAY</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On the quay, awaiting the disembarkment of
their relatives on board our ship, stand four
or five Parsi ladies—all ugly, as only members of
that exclusive, inbred race can be ugly. They
wear Indian <span class='it'>saris</span>, with European blouses, stockings,
and high-heeled canvas shoes. In one hand
they hold black umbrellas, in the other garlands
of flowers. The black umbrellas are for use
against the sun; the wreaths of tuberoses and oleanders
are to hang round the necks of their returning
friends. One of the ladies, we are confidentially
informed, is an eminent woman doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dozen coolies, thin-limbed like spider-monkeys,
are drafted to wheel up the gangway.
They lay their hands on it, they simultaneously
utter a loud cry—in the hope, evidently, that the
gangway will take fright and move of its own
accord. But their faith is insufficient; the gangway
does not stir. Sadly, with sighs, they make
up their mind to shove. A vulgar, commonplace,
and tiring method of making things move. But
at least it works. The gangway rolls across the
quay, is hoisted into position. Passengers begin
to leave the ship. The friends and relations of
the Parsi ladies at last come down the plank. They
are embraced, lassoed with flowers, and led off
to the attendant Hupmobiles and Overlands behind
the Custom House. It is our first view of
the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brown skins, the bare feet, the nose-rings,
the humped bullocks—all these things were foreseeable,
seemed obvious and familiar from the
moment of landing. The really odd, unexpected
thing about Bombay was its birds. There are
more birds in the streets of this million-peopled
city than in an English woodland. Huge kites,
their wings spread and unmoving, go soaring
along the thoroughfares, effortlessly keeping pace
with the traffic below. Innumerable grey-headed
crows fly hither and thither, sit perched on every
roof, every sill and wire. Their cawing is the
fundamental bass to every other sound in Bombay.
Kites and crows do useful scavenging work, and
Bombay, which produces much garbage and few
dustmen, keeps them well employed and copiously
fed. Nobody, in this land where the killing of
animals is all but murder, does them or their nests
any harm. They increase and multiply, they are
astonishingly unafraid. All over India we were
to find the same abundance of bird life, the same
trustful absence of fear. Coming from Italy,
where, for nine months of the year, while <span class='it'>lo sport</span>
is in progress, the countryside is almost birdless,
where armed men lie ambushed half a day for a
hedge-sparrow, and migrant warblers are netted
and eaten by the thousand—coming from Italy,
I was particularly impressed by the number and
variety of Indian birds.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BOMBAY</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Architecturally, Bombay is one of the
most appalling cities of either hemisphere.
It had the misfortune to develop during what
was, perhaps, the darkest period of all architectural
history. Most of its public buildings were
designed and executed between 1860 and 1900.
It is hardly necessary for me to expatiate or comment.
All that need be said has been said perfectly
in the guide-book; then, let the guide-book
speak. The Presidential Secretariat, we are told,
is in “the Venetian Gothic style.” The University
Hall (completed 1874), which is “in the French
Decorated style of the fifteenth century,” rubs
shoulders with the “Early English” Law Courts
(opened in 1879). The University Library,
harking back to an earlier century than the Hall,
is “in the style of fourteenth century Gothic.”
The Old General Post Office “was designed in the
mediæval style by Mr. Trubshawe.” (Mr. Trubshawe
was cautiously unspecific.) The Telegraph
Office (date not mentioned, but my knowledge of
architectural fashions makes me inclined to a
rather later epoch) is “Romanesque.” The Victoria
Station, of which the style is “Italian Gothic
with certain oriental modifications in the domes,”
confronts the Municipal Buildings, in which “the
oriental feeling introduced into the Gothic architecture
has a pleasing effect.” More frankly oriental
are the Gateway of India (“based on the
work of the sixteenth century in Gujarat”) and
the Prince of Wales Museum (“based on the Indian
work of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
in the Presidency.”) The architecture of the
Hotel Majestic and the Taj Mahal Hotel is not
described in the guide-book. It is a remissness;
they deserve description. The Majestic is more
wildly Mohammedan than anything that the most
orthodox of Great Moguls ever dreamed of,
and the gigantic Taj combines the style of the
South Kensington Natural History Museum with
that of an Indian pavilion at an International Exhibition.
After an hour passed among these treasures
of modern architecture, I took a cab, and in
mere self-defence drove to the Town Hall, which
is a quiet, late Georgian affair, built in the ’thirties.
Long and low, with its flight of steps, its central
pediment, its Doric colonnade, it has an air of
calm and quiet decency. Among so many architectural
cads and pretentious bounders, it is almost
the only gentleman. In Bombay, it seems as good
as the Parthenon.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BOMBAY</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In the lounge of the hotel is a bookstall, stocked
with periodicals and novels—my own, I was
gratified to see, among them. One whole section
of the bookstall is devoted to the sale of English
and American technical journals—but technical
journals of a single, rather special kind. Journals
of gynæcology, of obstetrics, of sexual psychology,
of venereal disease. Rows of them, and dozens of
copies of each. The hotel lounge is not specially
frequented by doctors; it is the general public
which buys these journals. Strange, strange
phenomenon! Perhaps it is one of the effects of
the climate.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BOMBAY</h2>

<p class='pindent'>From its island body, Bombay radiates long
tentacles of suburban squalor into the land.
Mills and huge grey tenements, low huts among
the palm-trees flank the outgoing roads for miles,
and the roads themselves are thronged with the
coming and going of innumerable passengers.
Driving out of Bombay along one of these populous
highways, I felt (but more acutely) that
amazement which often overwhelms me when I
pass through the sordid fringes of some European
city—amazement at my own safety and comfort, at
the security of my privileges, at the unthinking
and almost unresentful acceptance by millions of
my less fortunate fellow-beings of my claim to be
educated, leisured, comparatively wealthy. That
I and my privileged fellows should be tolerated
by our own people seems to me strange enough.
But that our pretensions, which are still higher in
India than in Europe, should be allowed by these
innumerable dark-skinned strangers, over whom
we rule, strikes me as being still more extraordinary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are accepted much as paper money is accepted,
because there is a general belief that we
are worth something. Our value is not intrinsic,
but borrowed from the opinion of the world. We
live and rule on credit and are respected, not so
much because we are really formidable (though
our power is great) as because there exists a convention
that we should be respected. The less
fortunate majority is carefully educated in this
useful opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our paper currency has begun to lose its conventional
value in Europe. We still continue to
offer ourselves (often with a certain secret diffidence)
as five-pound notes; but the more sceptical
of our “inferiors” refuse to regard us as anything
more precious than waste paper. When the same
thing begins to happen in India, when the credit
on which the white man has been living and ruling
for so long is withdrawn, what then? Without
any violence, merely by quietly refusing to accept
the white man at his own valuation, merely by
declining to have anything to do with him, the
Indian can reduce British rule to impotence. Non-co-operation
has failed, up till now, owing to inefficiency
of organisation and a lack of public
spirit on the part of the Indians. But efficient
organisation and public spirit are the products of
a special education. When the masses have received
that education, when the paper money of
European prestige has been systematically discredited
and individual Europeans are boycotted
and left suspended in a kind of social and economic
vacuum, the Indians will be able to get
whatever they ask for. (The mere disappearance
of all Indian servants would be almost enough in
itself to bring the white man to terms. Faced with
the prospect of having to empty his own slops, a
Viceroy would begin to listen with an increased
sympathy to Swarajist demands.) Whether the
Indians will succeed any better than the English
in the task of governing India, is another question.
Swaraj may prove a blessing, or it may turn out
to be a catastrophe. But in any case it will be
obtained whenever a sufficient number of India’s
three hundred and twenty millions make up their
minds systematically to ask for it; the thing is
obvious. They have only to be incredulous of the
white man’s pretensions, they have only to ignore
his almost invisible presence among their multitudes;
that is all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the meantime, however, our credit holds, at
any rate among the masses. The educated Indian
may doubt whether our five-pound notes are worth
more than an equal area snipped out of the <span class='it'>Daily
Mail</span>; but his uneducated brother still accepts us
at our face value. Thin-legged pedestrians salute
me as I pass. Through the squalor of suburban
Bombay, I carry my privileges of comfort, culture,
and wealth in perfect safety. They are still secure,
more or less, even in the suburbs of an English
manufacturing town. For how long? Rolling
along between the palm-trees, I wonder.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BOMBAY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It has been our good fortune, while in Bombay,
to meet Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, the newly-elected
President of the All-India Congress and a woman
who combines in the most remarkable way great
intellectual power with charm, sweetness with
courageous energy, a wide culture with originality,
and earnestness with humour. If all Indian politicians
are like Mrs. Naidu, then the country is
fortunate indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a tea-party in her rooms, a young Mohammedan
of Arab descent recited some verses in
Urdu by the modern Panjabi poet Iqbal. The
subject was Sicily (and “Sicily,” alas, was the only
word in the poem which I could understand).
The poet, we were told, had been inspired to write
while passing through the Straits of Messina on
his return from a European voyage, and his poem
was in the nature of a lament—a Mohammedan’s
indignant lament that the island which had once
belonged to the Musulmans should now be in the
hands of infidels. I did not say so at the time, but
I must confess that the idea of Sicily as a Mohammedan
country cruelly ravished from its rightful
owners, the Arabs, struck me as rather shocking.
For us good Europeans, Sicily is Greek, is Latin,
is Christian, is Italian. The Arab occupation is
an interlude, an irrelevance. True, the Arabs in
Sicily were the best sort of civilised Arabs. But
it is hard for us to regard them as anything but
trespassers on that classical ground. And now I was
being expected to look upon Theocritus’s island—just
as Italians before the war looked on the Trentino
and other fragments of <span class='it'>Italia irredenta</span>—as
a piece of “unredeemed Araby.” It was asking too
much. For the first moment, I felt quite indignant—just
as indignant, no doubt, as the poet had
felt at the sight of those once Mohammedan shores
now polluted by Christians. In the traveller’s life
these little lessons in the theory of relativity are
daily events.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words of the poem were incomprehensible
to me. But at least I was able to appreciate the
way in which it was recited, or rather chanted—for
the stanzas were set to a regularly recurrent
melody in the minor key. Each verse began with
a stirring phrase that rose, like the call of a trumpet,
from the dominant to the tonic, and, at the
next strong beat, to the minor third. After that,
the melody mournfully wandered; there were suspended
notes and long shakes on a single vowel.
It was thus, I felt sure, as I listened, it was thus
that the Greek choruses must have been recited—to
a chant kept well within the limits of a single
octave, a chant (to our ears, at least) somewhat
monotonous, sung without strain, more in a speaking
voice than in what we should regard as a
singing voice. And in the suspended notes, in the
shakes and warblings over a single long-drawn
syllable, I seemed to recognise that distinguishing
feature of the Euripidean chorus which Aristophanes
derides and parodies in the <span class='it'>Frogs</span>.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BOMBAY</h2>

<p class='pindent'>This evening a congratulatory address was
presented to Mr. Patel, the new Speaker of
the Legislative Assembly, by the members of his
community, an agricultural sub-caste of Gujarat.
Other members of the community have broken
through the traditionary trammels—the hall was
full of men who had left the ancestral plough for
work in the city—but none has previously risen to
a position so exalted as that attained by Mr. Patel.
“From Ploughboy to President”—Indian journalists,
like their colleagues across the sea, have a
weakness for phrases—was the phrase in which
the newspapers summed up Mr. Patel’s career.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We accompanied Mrs. Naidu to the function
and, as her guests, found ourselves sitting in places
of honour on the platform. The hall was crowded.
The heat, though the sun had set, was prodigious.
(It is one of the peculiarities of the Bombay climate
that the temperature rises, or at any rate
seems to rise, during the first hours of the night.)
In the garden outside, a band was playing the
fox-trots of two or three seasons ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The programme of the function had been carefully
worked out. A chorus of children was to
sing during the period of waiting before Mr. Patel
entered. Somebody was to recite a congratulatory
poem when he had taken his seat. Then there
were to be speeches, with Mr. Patel’s reply and
the presentation of the address in its silver casket
to finish off the proceedings. A perfect programme,
on paper; but in practice, as it turned
out, not quite so good as it might have been. For
the band played and the audience talked all
through the children’s singing; indeed, it was only
quite by chance, because I happened to notice that
they were opening and shutting their mouths in an
unnatural, fish-like sort of way, that I came to
know that the children were singing at all. And
when the reciter began intoning his congratulatory
poem, the indefatigable band struck up the tune
of “Why did you kiss that Girl?”—the poem was
lost. But by this time some few thousands of
Bombay’s innumerable population of crows had
settled in the trees outside the hall and were discussing
the question, as gregarious birds will do
at sunset, of retiring for the night. Their cawing
was portentous. Never in Europe have I heard
anything like it. I was sitting on the platform,
within a few feet of the speakers; but their voices
were quite inaudible, even to me. It was only
some half an hour later, when the crows had
dropped off to sleep, that any word can have
reached the audience. After that the proceedings
went off pretty smoothly, and with only a little
hitch or two about the reading of the address and
the presentation of the casket to mar the solemnity
of the occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was reminded very much of analogous functions
in Italy. There is no word of which Italian
journalists are fonder than the word <span class='it'>solenne</span>.
Every ceremony of which you read an account in
an Italian newspaper is solemn—solemn foundation-stone
layings, solemn depositings of wreaths
on tombs, solemn celebrations of centenaries,
solemn royal entrances and exits. In the papers,
as I say, all these things are solemn. In practice,
however, they are rarely anything but slipshod,
haphazard, and to northern eyes at any rate, ineffective
and unimpressive. The good Catholic
who comes to Rome in the hope of seeing noble
and soul-stirring religious ceremonies, generally
returns disappointed to his own country. The fact
is that they order these things better in France, in
England, in Belgium, in Germany—in any northern
land. We Northerners stage-manage our effects
more professionally than do the people of the
south. We take pains to impress ourselves; and
at the same time we give the ceremony which we
have staged every chance of seeming impressive
to us by deliberately throwing ourselves into a
serious state of mind and consistently keeping our
seriousness till the function is over. The Southerner
declines to take trouble over the details of
stage-management, and will not be bothered to
hold one mental attitude for a long time at a
stretch. To us, in consequence, he seems disgracefully
slipshod, cynical, and irreverent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we must not be over-hasty in our judgments.
The Southerner has his own traditions about these
matters, and they happen to be different from ours.
In this respect, I should guess, his habits of
thought and feeling are nearer to the Oriental’s
than to ours. Let us try to understand before we
condemn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We call the Southerner slipshod because he
tolerates shabbiness among his grandeurs, and permits
his solemnities to be marred by a ludicrous inefficiency.
But he could retort by calling us crassly
unimaginative because we are incapable of seeing
the fine intention through the inadequate medium
of its expression, of appreciating the noble general
effect in spite of the shabbiness of the details. For
in matters of art, he would argue (and a religious
ceremony, a civic or political function are forms
of art, being only solemn ballets and symbolical
charades), it is the intention and the general effect
that count. Those little struts and flying buttresses
of marble, with which the Greeks strengthened
their statues, are absurd, if you choose to consider
them closely. But they are meant to be ignored.
Structurally, a sham façade is ludicrous; the Southerner
knows it, of course, just as well as Mr.
Ruskin. But, more wise than Ruskin, he does
not fly into a passion of moral indignation over
the falsehood of it; he permits himself to enjoy
the genuine grandiosity of its appearance when
seen from the right angle. In church, the priest
may gabble, as though he were trying to break
a world’s record, the acolytes may pick their
noses, the choir-boys sing out of tune, the
vergers spit; we Northerners are revolted, but
the wisely indulgent Southerner passes over these
trivial details, and enjoys the fine general effect of
the ecclesiastical ballet in spite of its little blemishes.
But if he enjoys it, the Northerner now
asks, why doesn’t he at least sit still and refrain
from laughing chatter, why doesn’t he try to look,
and looking, make himself feel, consistently serious?
To which the other will retort by deriding
the Northerner’s slowness and inelasticity of mind,
his pomposity, his incapacity for frankly feeling
two emotions at once, or at any rate in very rapid
succession. “I can see ludicrous and shabby details
just as clearly as you do,” he will say, “and,
like you, I deplore them. But I keep my sense
of proportion, and do not permit mere details
to interfere with my appreciation of the general
effect. You have a talent for high seriousness;
but I can smile and feel solemn within the
same minute. In church I pray fervently at one
moment, I am transported by the beauty of the
ceremonial (in spite of the shoddy details), and
the next I make eyes at the young woman across
the aisle or talk to my neighbour about the price
of rubber shares. Operatic airs, I know, are
stagey and conventional, and I deride the ludicrously
strutting tenor who sings them; but at
the same time I rapturously applaud his bawling
and abandon myself, even while I mock, to the
throaty passion of the music. Your mind is clumsier,
more stiffly starched than mine. You can
only be one thing at a time, and you regard as
shocking the nimble emotional antics of those more
fortunately endowed than yourself or more reasonably
brought up. For my part I can only pity
you for your limitations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The speeches, all but that of Mrs. Naidu, who
gave us English eloquence, were in Gujarati, and
for me, therefore, no better than gibberish. I
amused myself by listening for the occasional English
words with which the incomprehensibility was
powdered. “Gibber gibber gibber Bombay Presidency”;
it was thus that I should have reported a
typical speech of the evening. “Gibber gibber
committee, gibber gibber gibber minority report,
gibber gibber Government of India, gibber gibber
gibber George Washington, gibber Edmund
Burke, gibber gibber gibber Currency Commission,
gibber gibber gibber gibber .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” It was
thus, I reflected, that our Saxon fathers borrowed
from the invaders’ speech the words for which
they could find no equivalent in their own debased,
post-Conquest English. Listening to the incomprehensible
chatter of his foreign vassals, the Norman
baron would have been amused to catch,
every now and then, the sound of such familiar
words as “army,” “castle,” “law.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The function came to an end. Festooned with
flowers—for there had been a generous distribution
of garlands, by which even we, albeit quite
undeserving, had profited—we followed our hostess
into the garden. There under palm-trees, we
drank a kind of richly perfumed soda-water, we
ate strange dumplings stuffed with mincemeat that
was at once sweet and violently peppery—chopped
mutton mixed with a vitriolic jam—and tried to
take the burning taste of them away with little
cakes and sandwiches, slabs of almond icing and
fried savouries. At the other side of the garden,
safely removed from possible contamination, the
orthodox refreshed themselves with special foods
prepared by cooks of guaranteed good family.
White-bearded and most majestically robed, Mr.
Patel moved among the guests, looking like a
minor, even a major, prophet—but a prophet, as
we saw when he sat down at table, with a most
reassuringly humorous twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was nearly nine when we got back to the
hotel. Coming up from dinner, an hour later, we
found our room magically perfumed by the tuberoses
and champaks of our garlands. That night,
and all next day, till they were quite withered,
the flowers poured out their scent, and the wind
driven down on us by the electric fan in the ceiling
was a warm air impregnated with strange and
tropical sweetness.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>KASHMIR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It is cheaper in this country to have a waggon
pulled by half a dozen men than by a pair of
oxen or horses. All day, on the road below our
house, the heavy-laden carts go creaking slowly
along behind their team of human draft animals.
The coolies sing as they pull, partly out of sheer
lightness of heart (for these Kashmiris are wonderfully
cheerful, in spite of everything), and
partly, no doubt, because they have discovered
the psychological fact that to sing in chorus creates
a strengthening sense of solidarity within the singing
group, and seems to lighten the work in hand
by making the muscular effort respond almost
automatically to a regular rhythmic stimulus. I
noticed two main types of labourer’s chantey.
One of these is melodically quite ambitious; for
it ranges over no less than three notes of the minor
scale. It is sung in unison, and there is no separate
chorus leader. The commonest form of the melody
is more or less as follows:</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/music.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0002' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='it'>Da capo</span> ad infinitum. They sing it all day at
their work and half the night as well, for fun,
when there happens to be a wedding or some similar
festival. The other chantey takes the form of
a kind of dialogue between the chorus and a
chorus leader, who responds to the two strong
beats of the choral song by a single monosyllable,
always the same, sustained for two beats, and sung
emphatically on a lower note. The words were
incomprehensible to me; but translated into terms
of gibberish, they sounded something like this:
<span class='it'>Chorus</span>, Dum-dum. <span class='it'>Leader</span>, <span class='sc'>Bong</span>. <span class='it'>Chorus</span>,
Tweedle-dum. <span class='it'>Leader</span>, <span class='sc'>Bong</span>; Tum-diddy, <span class='sc'>Bong</span>;
Tweedle-weedle, <span class='sc'>Bong</span>. And so on, hour after
hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This rhythmical dialogue is the favourite music
of the waggon teams. Walking abroad, one is
never for long out of hearing of that monotonous
Dum-dum, <span class='sc'>Bong</span>; ditty-dum, <span class='sc'>Bong</span>. The singing
floats down between the poplar trees of the straight
flat roads of the valley, and slowly, laboriously
the waggon and its human crew come following
after the swift-travelling song. Passing, I feel
almost ashamed to look at the creeping wain; I
avert my eyes from a spectacle so painfully accusatory.
That men should be reduced to the performance
of a labour which, even for beasts, is
cruel and humiliating, is a dreadful thing. “Ah,
but they feel things less than we do,” the owners
of motor cars, the eaters of five meals a day, the
absorbers of whisky hasten to assure me; “they feel
them less, because they’re used to this sort of life.
They don’t mind, because they know no better.
They’re really quite happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And these assertions are quite true. They do
not know better; they <span class='it'>are</span> used to this life; they are
incredibly resigned. All the more shame to the
men and to the system that have reduced them
to such an existence and kept them from knowing
anything better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is in relation to their opposites that things
have significance for us. “Opposite shows up opposite,
as a Frank a negro.” So wrote Jalalu ’d-Din
Muhammad Rumi. “The opposite of light
shows what is light.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. God created grief and
pain for this purpose: to wit, to manifest happiness
by its opposites. Hidden things are manifested
by their opposites; but as God has no opposite,
He remains hidden.” These Kashmiri
draft coolies, who are unaware of comfort, culture,
plenty, privacy, leisure, security, freedom, do not
in consequence know that they are slaves, do not
repine at being herded together in filthy hovels
like beasts, do not suffer from their ignorance, and
are resigned to being overworked and underfed.
Those who profit by the Kashmiri’s ignorant acquiescence
in such sub-human conditions are naturally
not anxious that they should be made aware
of the desirable opposites which would make their
present life seem odious. The spread of education,
the improvement of living conditions are
causes which do not rouse them to enthusiasm.
And yet, in spite of everything, the spirit of humanitarianism
works even through these reluctant
agents. For the spirit of humanitarianism is the
spirit of the age, which it is impossible for any
man, born with the usual supply of social instinct
and suggestibility, completely to ignore. His
reason may tell him that his own personal advantage
would be best served if he kept the disinherited
in their places. But a stronger force
than reason is for ever trying to make him act
against reason. To be utterly ruthless towards the
disinherited would be profitable; but he can never
bring himself to be utterly ruthless. In spite of
himself, he feels that he ought to give them justice.
And he gives it—not very often, no doubt, and
not very much at a time—but still, he gives it;
that is the queer, significant, and <span class='it'>modern</span> thing.
Even in Kashmir a tiny pinch of this humanitarian
commodity—as yet, however, all but invisible—has
begun to be distributed.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SRINAGAR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Mogul gardens are disappointingly inferior
to any of the more or less contemporary
gardens of Italy. Shalimar and Nishat Bagh cannot
compare with the Villa d’Este at Tivoli, or the
Villa Lanti, near Viterbo. The little Chashma
Shahi is architecturally the most charming of the
gardens near Srinagar. And the loveliest for
trees and waters is Atchibal, at the upper end of
the valley; while far-off Verinag, where Jahangir
enclosed the blue deep source of the Jhelum in an
octagonal tank surrounded by arcades, has a
strange and desolate beauty all its own. But in
general it may be said that the design of all these
Indian gardens is rigid, monotonous, and lacking
entirely in the Italian grandiosity, the Italian fertility
of invention. The architecture of the pleasure
houses which they contain is petty and almost
rustic. The decorative details, such of them, at
any rate, as remain—for the ornamentation was
mostly of a rather gimcrack and temporary character—are
without much originality. How
greatly the Mogul architects were handicapped by
the profession of a religion which forbade the introduction
of the human form into their decorative
schemes is manifested especially in their fountains.
A fountain in one of these gardens is just
a nozzle sticking out of the ground, the end of a
hose-pipe turned vertically upwards. Miserable
object, and unworthy of the name of fountain! I
shut my eyes and think of those Bolognese mermaids
with their spouting breasts; those boys and
tortoises at Rome, all black and shining with wetness;
those naiads and river-gods and gesticulating
allegories among the rainbows and the falling
crystals of the Piazza Navons; those Tritons at
the Villa Lanti with their prancing sea-horses—all
the fantastic world of tutelary deities that
stand guard over Italian springs. The Moguls
were good Mohammedans and content with unadorned
nozzles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Kashmiri gardens are beautiful, that is
the work, not so much of man as of nature. The
formal beds are full of zinnias and scarlet cannas.
The turf is fresh and green. The huge chenar
trees go up into the pale bright sky; their white
trunks shine between the leaves, which the autumn
has turned to a rusty vermilion. Behind them
are the steep bare hills, crested already with snow.
Their colour, where the sun strikes them, is a kind
of silvery-glaucous gold and, in the shadows, a
deep intense indigo. Below, on the other side,
stretches the Dal Lake, with the isolated fort-crowned
hill of Hari-Parbat on the further shore.
The sun shines out of a flawless sky, but the air is
cool against the face. “It is a nipping and an
eager air”; for we are at more than five thousand
feet above the sea. The Great Moguls regarded
Kashmir as the earthly paradise. And a paradise
to one coming fresh from the earthly hell of the
Panjab in summer it must indeed have seemed.
The visitor from temperate lands finds it less paradisiacal
because more familiar. The lakes and
mountains remind us of Switzerland and Italy,
and in the level valley, with its interminable poplar
avenues, its waterways, and soggy fields, we
find ourselves thinking of France, of Holland
even. Our ecstasies of admiration are reserved for
the unfamiliar tropics.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SRINAGAR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In the autumn great flocks of teal and mallard
come through Kashmir, on their way from the
breeding-grounds to their winter home in Northern
India. Some breed in the recesses of Ladakh,
a few hundred miles only from the Kashmir valley;
but the majority, it is said, go further afield
into Central Asia, possibly even into Siberia,
where so many migrants pass the brief but generous
summer. In the autumn they fly southwards,
over the Himalayas, into India. Some varieties of
these water-fowl cross the range at the eastern end,
some to the west. Thus the cotton-tail, I am assured
by sportsmen, is found in Assam and Bengal,
but not in the Panjab; while the mallard is seen
only in the west. How these birds, which normally
spend their lives in the plain, contrive to
pass the Himalayas without dying of mountain-sickness
or asphyxiation on the way, is something
of a mystery. Most small animals, when taken
up suddenly to a height of fifteen or twenty thousand
feet—and many of the Himalayan passes
touch these heights—simply die. The migrating
duck, if it really does come down from Central
Asia, must be flying at these altitudes for miles at
a stretch. Physiologically, the feat seems almost
as extraordinary as that of the eel, which leaves its
native pond or river to breed, two or three thousand
miles away, in the deep water of the ocean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would be interesting to know the feelings of a
migrant animal, when the moment has arrived for
it to perform its journey. The swallow at the end
of the summer, the salmon when, having attained
its maximum weight, it feels that the time has
come for it to go up into the rivers, the fresh-water
eel at the approach of its first and final
breeding season, must feel, I imagine, much as a
man might feel when suddenly converted, or who
finds himself compelled by an irresistible sense of
duty to perform some hazardous and disagreeable
enterprise. Some power within them—an immanent
god—commands them to change their comfortable
way of life for a new and arduous existence.
There is no disobeying the command; the
god compels. If eels could formulate their theories
of ethics, they would be eloquent, I am sure, about
the categorical imperative and the compulsive
character of the sense of duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our categorical imperatives, like those of eels
and swallows, are generally backed by the forces
of an instinct. Our social instinct deters us from
doing what we think would be condemned, and
encourages us to do what we think would be commended
by our equals, by our moral superiors, by
our “better selves,” by “God.” But there are occasions,
curiously enough, when the categorical
imperative to do or refrain from doing seems to
have no connection with a compulsive instinct. For
example, a man writes two letters, addresses two
envelopes, puts the letters into the envelopes, and
seals them up. He is extremely careful when inserting
the letters, to see that each goes into its
proper envelope. Nevertheless, a few minutes
later, he is seized by an irresistible desire to reopen
the envelopes so as to make sure that the letter to
his mistress is not in the envelope addressed to his
maiden aunt, and <span class='it'>vice versa</span>. He knows that each
letter is where it should be. But despite his conviction,
despite the derisive comments of the rational
part of his mind, he does reopen the
envelopes. The categorical imperative is stronger
than reason. It may be so strong that after five
more minutes, he will open the envelopes a second
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What gives the imperative its strength in cases
such as this, I am at a loss to imagine. The August
cuckoo takes wing for Africa at the command of
a special migratory instinct. A desire born of his
social instinct, to win the approval of his fellows,
of some hypostasized “better self” or “personal
god” makes a man act honourably in circumstances
where it would be more profitable and more convenient
to act dishonourably. But when a man
reopens an envelope to see if it contains the letter
he <span class='it'>knows</span> it does contain, when he gets out of bed
on a cold night to make sure that he has switched
off the light and bolted the doors which he clearly
remembers turning out and bolting ten minutes
before, no primary instinct can be evoked to account
for the compulsive nature of the desire to
do these irrational things. In such cases the categorical
imperative seems to be morally senseless
and psychologically unaccountable. It is as
though a god were playing practical jokes.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SRINAGAR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Kashmiris are proverbial throughout
India for the filthiness of their habits.
Wherever a choice is offered them between cleanliness
and dirt, they will infallibly choose the latter.
They have a genius for filthiness. We had daily
opportunities of observing the manifestations of
this peculiar genius. Our compound was provided
with water from the city supply. From a
tap at the end of the garden we could draw the
pure filtered water of the reservoir among the
mountains. The water from this tap, which was
left running for hours at a time, was collected in
a small brick-lined tank, on which the gardener
drew for the watering of his flowers. And not
the gardener only. We found that our servants
had an almost irresistible desire to fetch our washing
and drinking water from the same source.
The fresh water ran sparkling from the tap; but
their instinct was to take only the standing fluid
in the uncovered tank. And to what uses the tank
was put! Looking out in the morning, we could
see our sweeper crouching on the brink to perform
his ablutions. First he washed his hands,
then his feet, then his face; after that he thoroughly
rinsed his mouth, gargled and spat into the
tank. Then he douched his nose. And when that
was finished, he scooped some water in his hands
and took a drink. A yard away was the tap. He
preferred the tastier water of the tank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The astonishing thing is that epidemics are not
more frequent and severe than is actually the case.
That they are not is due, I suppose, to the powerful
disinfectant action of the sunlight. Perhaps also
an almost daily and domestic familiarity with the
germs of typhoid and cholera has bred among
Kashmiri phagocytes a healthy contempt for their
attacks, together with increased powers of resistance.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SRINAGAR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Kashmiri pandit has a more than Spanish
objection to manual labour. But, unlike the
hidalgo who thought himself dishonoured by the
exercise of any profession save that of arms, the
pandit is ambitious of wielding only the pen. He
may be abjectly poor (most people are abjectly
poor in Kashmir); but he will do only a pandit’s
work. Chauffeurs may get good wages, servants
are clothed and fed; but the proud pandit had
rather walk the streets begging than accept employments
so derogatory to his Brahmin dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are many pandits in Kashmir. They are
all educated, more or less, and all equally proud.
The consequence is that, in Kashmir, you can hire
a clerk for about half as much as you would have
to pay your cook. And not in Kashmir only.
It is the same throughout the whole of India. A
circus recently visited Lahore. The management
advertised for gate-keepers at fifteen rupees a
month. Among the applicants, I was told, were
upwards of forty graduates. Mysore, the best-governed
of the Indian States, finds the same difficulty
in disposing of the finished products of its
higher education. After having gone to the
trouble of taking their degrees, the graduates of
its colleges demand, almost as a right (it is only
natural), the work for which their educational
attainments fit them. But the work does not exist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is the farcical tragedy of Indian education.
The Universities produce a swarm of graduates,
for whom there is nothing to do. The State can
employ only a limited number of them and, outside
the government service, there is almost no
opening for a man with the ordinary general education
of the West. The industrial and commercial
activities, to which most of our young educated
men devote themselves, hardly exist in India.
There is no available liquid capital to start such
industries on a large scale, and the average educated
Indian lacks the enterprise and energy to
begin in a small way on his own. His ambition
is to step into some safe clerical job with no responsibilities,
and a pension at the end of it. A
“crammed” education in the humanities or in pure
science hardly fits him for anything else. Unhappily,
the number of safe clerkships with pensions
attached is strictly limited. The Indian
youth steps out of the University examination hall
into a vacuum. The class of educated unemployed—the
class most dangerous to an established
government—steadily grows.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SRINAGAR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Educated Indians of the older generation
have a great weakness for apophthegms, quotations,
and cracker mottoes. They punctuate their
conversation with an occasional “As the Persian
poet so beautifully puts it”: then follows a string
of incomprehensible syllables, with their appended
translation, which generally embodies some such
gem of human wisdom as “Honesty is the best
policy,” or “The higher the art, the lower the
morals,” or “My uncle’s house is on a hill, but I
cannot eat this rotten cabbage.” Those whose
education has been of a more occidental cast have
Gray’s <span class='it'>Elegy</span>, the works of Sir Edwin Arnold, and
the more sententious parts of Shakespeare at their
finger-tips. But among the younger Indians the
quotation habit seems to be dying out. Their
wisdom is diffuse and unquotable. Their minds
are stored with the nebulous débris of newspaper
articles, pamphlets, and popular science booklets,
not with heroic couplets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the same with us in the West. Latin tags
issue from the mouths only of the aged. The days
when Virgil and Horace were bandied from one
side of the House of Commons to the other are
past. Latin with us, like Persian among the
Indians, is a deader language than it was a century,
even a generation, ago. Even the English classics
are rarely quoted now. Young people trot out
their Shakespeare less frequently than do their
elders. The reason, I suppose, is this: we read
so much, that we have lost the art of remembering.
Indeed, most of what we read is nonsense, and not
meant to be remembered. The man who remembered
the social paragraphs in his morning paper
would deserve to be sent to an asylum. So it comes
about that we forget even that which is not worthy
of oblivion. Moreover, to young people brought
up in this queer provisional patchwork age of ours,
and saturated with its spirit, it seems absurd to
collect the rags of thought bequeathed by other
and, they feel, utterly different ages. What is
the use of knowing, in 1925, that “when lovely
woman stoops to folly,” the best, the only thing
she can do “is to die”? What is the good of asserting
baldly that “the quality of mercy is not
strained,” that “God’s in His heaven, all’s right
with the world”? These poetical statements have
no meaning for us. When lovely woman stoops to
folly, we do not think of death; we think of suppressed
complexes and birth-control and the rights
of the unmarried mother. About the quality of
mercy we have our own contemporary ideas; how
we regard it depends on whether we are followers
of Gandhi on the one hand, or of Sorel, Lenin,
and Mussolini on the other. It falleth as the
gentle dew from heaven; it is twice blest. No
doubt. But what is this to us, who have our peculiar
problems about the rights and wrongs of violence
to decide in our own way? And what
meaning for us have those airy assertions about
God? God, we psychologists know, is a sensation
in the pit of the stomach, hypostasized; God, the
personal God of Browning and the modern theologian,
is the gratuitous intellectualist interpretation
of immediate psycho-physiological experiences.
The experiences are indubitably true for
those who feel them; but the interpretation of
them in terms of Browning’s personal God is illogical
and unjustifiable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, decidedly, the cracker mottoes of the ancients
are of no use to us. We need our own tags
and catch-words. The preceding paragraph is
full of them: complex, birth-control, violence for
an idea, psychology, and the rest. Few of these
words or of the ideas for which they stand have
yet found their way into poetry. For example,
God, the intellectually interpreted sensation in the
pit of the stomach, has not yet been crystallised
into couplets. His home is still the text-book, the
<span class='it'>Hibbert Journal</span> article. Like most of the rest
of our ideas He is unquotable. The ancients were
able to build up their notions of the world at
large round an elegant poetical skeleton. Less
fortunate, we have only a collection of scientific,
or sham-scientific, words and phrases to serve as
the framework of our philosophy of life. Our
minds and our conversation are consequently less
elegant than those of our fathers, whose ideas had
crystallised round such pleasing phrases as “<span class='it'>Sunt
lacrimæ rerum</span>,” “I could not love thee, dear, so
much, loved I not honour more,” and “A sense of
something far more deeply interfused.” Some
day, it may be, a poet will be found to reduce our
catch-words to memorable artistic form. By that
time, however, they will probably be as meaninglessly
out-of-date as the cracker mottoes of the
classics.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SRINAGAR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Srinagar owns a large population of sacred
cows and bulls that wander vaguely through
the streets, picking up such vegetable garbage,
grass, and fallen leaves as they can find. They
are small beasts—the half of good-sized English
cattle—and marvellously mild. Red rags mean
nothing to these little bulls, they can be trusted in
china shops—even in nurseries. Liberty, under-feeding,
and unlimited access to the females of
their species account, no doubt, for this surprising
gentleness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though harmless, these Hindu totems are
passively a nuisance. They will not attack you
as you walk or drive along the streets, but neither
will they get out of your way. They stand there,
meditatively ruminating, in the middle of the
road, and no shouting, no ringing of bells or hooting
of horns will send them away. Not until you
are right on top of them will they move. The
fact is, of course, that they know their own sacredness.
They have learned by long experience that
they can stand in the road as much as they like
and that, however furiously the klaxon sounds,
nothing will ever happen to them. Nothing; for
Kashmir, though its inhabitants are mostly Mohammedans,
is ruled by a pious Hindu dynasty.
Up till a few years ago a man who killed a cow
was sentenced to death. Under a milder dispensation
he now gets only a matter of seven years’
penal servitude. A salutary fear of cows is rooted
in the breast of every Kashmiri chauffeur. And
the totems know it. With a majestic impertinence
they stroll along the middle of the roads. When
one is a god, one does not disturb oneself for the
convenience of mere man, however importunate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the eye of pure reason there is something
singularly illogical about the way in which the
Hindus shrink from killing cows or eating their
flesh when dead, but have no scruples about making
the life of the sacred beasts, by their ill-treatment,
a hell on earth. So strict is the orthodoxy
of Kashmir, that Bovril is confiscated at the
frontier, and sportsmen are forbidden to shoot the
wild <span class='it'>nilgai</span>, which is not bovine at all, but happens
to be miscalled the “blue cow”; the very name is
sacred. And yet nothing is done to protect these
god-like animals from any cruelty that does not
actually result in death. They are underfed and,
when used as draft animals, mercilessly over-driven.
When the goad fails to make them move,
their driver will seize them by the tail and, going
through the motions of one who tries to start up
a Ford car, violently twist. In winter, when
fodder runs short, the Kashmiris pack their beasts
together in a confined space until they begin to
sweat, then turn them out into the snow, in the
hope that they will catch pneumonia and die. To
the eye of reason, I repeat it, it certainly seems
strange. But then the majority of human actions
are not meant to be looked at with the eye of
reason.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SRINAGAR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It takes the Tartar traders six weeks of walking
to get from Kashgar to Srinagar. They start
with their yaks and ponies in the early autumn,
when the passes are still free from snow and the
rivers, swollen in summer by its melting, have
subsided to fordableness. They walk into Kashmir,
and from Kashmir into India. They spend
the winter in India, sell what they have brought,
and in the following spring, when the passes are
once more open, go back into Turkestan with a
load of Indian and European fabrics, velvet and
plush and ordinary cotton, which they sell for
fabulous profit in their own country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We paid a visit to the Central Asian <span class='it'>sarai</span> at
Srinagar where the Tartars halt for a rest on their
way down into India. A dozen merchants with
their servants were encamped there: strange Mongolian
men, high-booted, trousered, jerkined in
thick cloth or sheepskin. They showed us their
wares: carpets, costly and cheap, from Kashgar
and the other oasis cities of the Tarim basin;
coarse felt mats, on which were rudely printed in
red and blue the most exquisite designs; hand-woven
and hand-printed cottons from Turkestan;
Chinese silks, jade and crystal; furs. We bought
a rug of the poorest quality, a thing of more cotton
than wool, but superbly patterned in colours that
were none the less beautiful for being manifestly
aniline. Also a felt mat in the design of which a
Greek decorative motive played a leading part.
That identity of the contemporary with the ancient
and classical form—was it due to the coincidence
of reinvention, to a modern importation
from the West? Or was it due, as I liked to think
it was, to the survival, through centuries of change
and tumult and in spite of invasions and slaughters,
of the art which Alexander’s adventurous successors,
the despots of Central Asia, implanted in that
once flourishing land beyond the mountains?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not know why it should be so; but there
is something peculiarly romantic about caravans
and the slow commerce of pedestrians. The spectacle
of a hundred laden yaks or ponies is enough
to fire the imagination; of a hundred laden trucks
leaves us entirely cold. We take no interest in the
merchant who sends his goods by train; but the
pedestrian merchant seems to us an almost beautiful
and heroic figure. And the aura of romance
which surrounded the Tartars was brightened in
our eyes when they showed us their medium of
exchange. Diving down into the recesses of their
greasy clothing, they pulled out for our inspection
glittering handfuls of gold. We examined
the coins. They were Russian ten-rouble pieces of
before the Revolution, all bright and new. The
head of the Tsar stood sharply out on them, as
though they had but yesterday issued from the
Imperial mint.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>TAXILA</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The country round Taxila, that ancient city
where Alexander rested and found an ally,
reminded me a little of the Roman Campagna.
The outworks of the Himalayas play the part of
the Alban and Sabine mountains. Ranges of
woodless Frascatis and desiccated Tivolis subside
into a grey and rolling plain. On sudden and unexpected
eminences rising out of this plain stand
the Indian equivalents of Nepi and Civita Castellana.
And here and there, on hill-tops, in the
open ground below, lie the ruins of the various
cities and temples which flourished and decayed,
were born anew, only to be sacked and plundered,
were re-edified, only to perish absolutely, between
the year 1500 before our era and the year 500
after Christ.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First cousins, they seem—these ruins—of the
tombs along the Appian Way, of Ostia and Hadrian’s
Villa (for ruins, whatever their date and
country, have a strong family resemblance among
themselves), and own brothers, I may add, to the
inhabited villages near by, which differ from the
ruins only in being dirtier and more dilapidated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The best preserved remains are those of the
Buddhist monastery and temple of Jaulian. The
temple is a <span class='it'>stupa</span> or relic mound, and must have
looked when intact, with its dome and spire of
superimposed umbrellas, something like the modern
Burmese pagoda—which is, of course, only a
local variation of the original Indian <span class='it'>stupa</span>. To-day,
nothing remains, but the base of the main
<span class='it'>stupa</span> with, all round it, a number of miniature
<span class='it'>stupas</span> or votive shrines. The monastery adjoins
the temple, and resembles almost exactly the ruins
of a Christian monastery. I noticed only one point
of difference: the Buddhist monks had bathrooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Round the base of the <span class='it'>stupa</span> and in niches in the
walls of the monastic cloisters, a quantity of sculpture
in stone, stucco, and clay remains intact and
in position. The Greek influence is manifest, even
in this work of the third century <span class='sc'>a.d.</span> The Hellenistic
leaven was active for centuries. Ages passed,
and many barbarian invasions swept across the
land before all traces of the Greek influence were
quite eradicated and the art of Northern India
became again entirely oriental.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quality of the work at Taxila is not particularly
high. Far finer carving has been found at
other sites in North-Western India. The best of
it is now in the Peshawar Museum, where I was
specially struck by some scenes from the life of
Buddha represented in high relief on a series of
small stone panels. These things have the vigour
and dramatic force, with much of the beauty of
composition characteristic of Italian Gothic sculpture.
I remember two in particular—Buddha in
the act of renouncing his family ties and Buddha
preaching from the mouth of a cave—that might
have been by Niccolo Pisano.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BETWEEN PESHAWAR AND LAHORE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At Peshawar we were seized with one of our
periodical financial panics. Money, in this
country, slips rapidly between the fingers, particularly
between the fingers of the tourist. Great
wads of it have to be handed out every time one
gets into the train; for fares are high and distances
enormous. No place in India seems to be less than
three hundred miles from any other place; the
longer journeys have to be measured in thousands.
Financial panics are justifiable. We decided to
travel second-class as far as Lahore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first hour or so we were alone in our
compartment. We congratulated ourselves on
having secured all the comfort and privacy of first-class
travelling at exactly half the price. In future,
we decided, we would always travel second.
But nature abhors a vacuum, and our compartment
was evidently the object of her special abhorrence.
When the train stopped at Campbellpur,
we were invaded. In the twinkling of an
eye our luxurious emptiness was filled to overflowing
with luggage and humanity. And what queer
specimens of humanity! The leader of the party
which now entered the compartment was a middle-aged
man wearing a yellow robe and, on his head,
a kind of quilted bonnet with hanging ear-flaps.
He was profusely garlanded with yellow chrysanthemums,
and had been followed on to the platform
by a large crowd of flower-bearing admirers
and devotees. Our ignorance of the language did
not permit us to discover who this exalted person
might be. But he was evidently some kind of high
priest, some Hindu pope of considerable holiness,
to judge by the respect which was paid him by
his numerous retinue and his admirers. His passage
along the line must have been well advertised;
for at every station our compartment was invaded
by a swarm of devotees who came to kiss the great
man’s feet and to crave a blessing, which in most
cases he seemed too lazy to give. Even the guards
and ticket-collectors and stationmasters came in to
pay their respects. The enthusiasm of one ticket-collector
was so great that he travelled about thirty
miles in our already packed compartment, simply
in order to be near the holy man. He, meanwhile,
passed the time by counting his money, which was
contained in a large brass-bound box, by loudly
eating and, later, dozing. Even at the stations
he did not take the trouble to rouse himself, but
reclined with closed eyes along his seat, and passively
permitted the faithful to kiss his feet.
When one is as holy as he evidently was, it is
unnecessary to keep up appearances, behave decently,
or do anything for one’s followers. Office
and hereditary honour claim the respect of a believing
people quite as much as personal merit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judging by appearances, which are often deceptive,
I should say that this particular holy man had
no personal merit, but a very great office. His
face, which had the elements of a fine and powerful
face, seemed to have disintegrated and run to
fat under the influence of a hoggish self-indulgence.
To look at, he was certainly one of the
most repulsive human specimens I have ever seen.
But of course he may in reality have been a saint
and an ascetic, a preacher and a practiser of the
moral doctrines formulated in the Gita, or even
one of those pure-souled oriental mystics who, we
are told, are to leaven the materialism of our Western
civilisation. He may have been, but I doubt
it. All that we could be certain of was that he
looked unpleasant, and was undoubtedly dirty;
also that he and his admirers exhaled the sour
stink of garments long unwashed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tolstoy objected to too much cleanliness on the
ground that to be too clean is a badge of class. It
is only the rich who can afford the time and money
to wash their bodies and shift their linen frequently.
The labourer who sweats for his living,
and whose house contains no bathroom, whose
wardrobes no superfluous shirts, must stink. It is
inevitable, and it is also right and proper, that he
should. Work is prayer. Work is also stink.
Therefore stink is prayer. So, more or less, argues
Tolstoy, who goes on to condemn the rich for not
stinking, and for bringing up their children to have
a prejudice against all stinks however natural and
even creditable. The non-stinker’s prejudice
against stink is largely a class prejudice, and therefore
to be condemned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tolstoy is quite right, of course. We, who were
brought up on open windows, clean shirts, hot
baths, and sanitary plumbing, find it hard to tolerate
twice-breathed air and all the odours which
crowded humanity naturally exhales. Our physical
education has been such that the majority of
our fellow-beings, particularly those less fortunately
circumstanced than ourselves, seem to us
slightly or even extremely disgusting. A man
may have strong humanitarian and democratic
principles; but if he happens to have been
brought up as a bath-taking, shirt-changing lover
of fresh air, he will have to overcome certain
physical repugnances before he can bring himself
to put those principles into practice to the extent,
at any rate, of associating freely with men and
women whose habits are different from his own.
It is a deplorable fact; but there it is. Tolstoy’s
remedy is that we should all stink together. Other
reformers desire to make it economically possible
for every man to have as many hot baths and to
change his shirt as often as do the privileged non-stinkers
at the present day. Personally, I prefer
the second alternative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, the crowd in our compartment increased.
The day, as it advanced, grew hotter.
And suddenly the holy man woke up and began to
hawk and spit all over the compartment. By the
time we reached Rawal Pindi we had decided that
the twenty-two rupees we should economise by
remaining seven hours longer among our second-class
brothers were not enough. We had our luggage
transferred into a first-class carriage and paid
the difference. The only other occupant of the
compartment was an English official of the Kashmir
State, bound for his winter headquarters at
Jammu. He was a dim little man; but at any
rate his linen was clean, and he was not in the
least holy. Nobody came in to kiss his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the rest of the journey I ruminated my anti-clericalism.
Indian friends have assured me that
the power of the priests is less than it was, and goes
on rapidly waning. I hope they are right and that
the process may be further accelerated. And not
in India alone. There is still, for my taste, too
much kissing of amethyst rings as well as of slippered
feet. There are still too many black coats
in the West, too many orange ones in the East.
<span class='it'>Écrasez l’infâme</span>. My travelling companion had
made me, for the moment, a thorough-going Voltairian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a simple creed, Voltairianism. In its simplicity
lies its charm, lies the secret of its success—and
also of its fallaciousness. For, in our muddled
human universe, nothing so simple can possibly be
true, can conceivably “work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the <span class='it'>infâme</span> were squashed, if insecticide were
scattered on all the clerical beetles, whether black
or yellow, if pure rationalism became the universal
faith, all would automatically be well. So
runs the simple creed of the anti-clericals. It is
too simple, and the assumptions on which it is
based are too sweeping. For, to begin with, is the
<span class='it'>infâme</span> always infamous, and are the beetles invariably
harmful? Obviously not. Nor can it be
said that the behaviour-value of pure rationalism
(whatever the truth-value of its underlying assumptions)
is necessarily superior to the behaviour-value
of irrational beliefs which may be and,
in general, almost certainly are untrue. And further,
the vast majority of human beings are not
interested in reason or satisfied with what it
teaches. Nor is reason itself the most satisfactory
instrument for the understanding of life. Such
are a few of the complications which render so
simple a formula as the anti-clerical’s inapplicable
to our real and chaotic existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Man’s progress has been contingent on his capacity
to organise societies. It is only when protected
by surrounding society from aggression,
when freed by the organised labour of society from
the necessity of hunting or digging for his food,
it is only, that is to say, when society has tempered
and to a great extent abolished the struggle for
personal existence, that the man of talent can
exercise his capacities to the full. And it is only
by a well-organised society that the results of his
labours can be preserved for the enrichment of
succeeding generations. Any force that tends to
the strengthening of society is, therefore, of the
highest biological importance. Religion is obviously
such a force. All religions have been
unanimous in encouraging within limits that have
tended to grow wider and ever wider, the social,
altruistic, humanitarian proclivities of man and in
condemning his anti-social, self-assertive tendencies.
Those who like to speak anthropomorphically
would be justified in saying that religion
is a device employed by the Life Force for the
promotion of its evolutionary designs. But they
would be justified in adding that religion is also a
device employed by the Devil for the dissemination
of idiocy, intolerance, and servile abjection.
My fellow passenger from Campbellpur did something,
no doubt, to encourage brotherly love, forbearance,
and mutual helpfulness among his flock.
But he also did his best to deepen their congenital
stupidity and prevent it from being tempered by
the acquirement of correct and useful knowledge,
he did his best to terrify them with imaginary fears
into servility and to flatter them with groundless
hopes into passive contentment with a life unworthy
of human beings. What he did in the name
of the evolutionary Life Force, he undid in the
name of the Devil. I cherish a pious hope that
he did just a trifle more than he undid, and that
the Devil remained, as the result of his ministry,
by ever so little the loser.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>LAHORE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Lahore Museum is rich in Indo-Persian
water-colours of the Mogul period. A few
of them are genuinely good. But all are in the
highest degree “amusing” (and in these days, after
all, it is to the amusing rather than to the good in
art that we pay our tribute of admiration).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subjects of these paintings are mostly scenes
of domestic and courtly life, as it was lived in the
great Imperial days. If we may judge by these
representations, the distractions of the Moguls
were remarkably simple, simpler even than those
in vogue among the grandees of Europe at the
same period. Hunting, war, and love-making,
from time immemorial the sports of kings, were
practised as copiously and patronised as freely by
Western potentates as by their Oriental cousins.
But the amusements of “looking at the clouds” was
never, so far as I am aware, a favourite pastime
among the great of Europe. In India, on the
contrary, it seems to have been one of the principal
occupations of kings and queens. So ordinary was
the pastime that the Mogul artists found it necessary
to invent a special pictorial convention to
represent it. These cloud-gazers, of whom quite
a surprising number are portrayed in the pictures
of the Lahore collection, are represented as standing
or reclining on the roofs of their palaces looking
up at a sky full of pitch-black vapours, against
which a flight of somewhat heraldic swans stands
out with a peculiar brilliance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Innocent pleasures! The capacity to enjoy them
is perhaps a sign of the superiority of Oriental
civilisation to our own. To Europeans, I am
afraid, this “looking at the clouds” would seem a
little tedious. But then, we are barbarians and
entirely ignorant of the art of living. One of
the choicest inventions in the field of this epicurean
art, of which we hurried Westerners know so
little, is frequently represented in these pictures.
It is shown in almost all the numerous love scenes
between black-bearded nawabs and fawn-eyed,
trousered beauties, which form the nucleus of this
delightful collection. Any fool, any savage can
make love—of a kind. But it needs a <span class='it'>viveur</span> of
genius to think of combining amorous dalliance—on
carpets, be it added, of the most exquisite Persian
design—with the leisured smoking of a silver
and crystal hookah. That, surely, is true art.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>LAHORE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>By the kindness of our hospitable friends at
Lahore, we were able to hear a good deal of
Indian music, both classical and popular. Indian
music is innocent of any harmony more subtle than
that with which the bagpipe has made us familiar—the
drone on the dominant. It knows of
no form more highly organised than that of the
air with variations. It is played on but few instruments
(two kinds of lute and a kind of wire-stringed
viola are the commonest), and these few
are, alas, rapidly being ousted by a form of miniature
American harmonium, pumped with one
hand and played with one finger of the other. Yet,
in spite of these limitations, Indian music is surprisingly
rich and various. How rich and how
various depends entirely upon the individual
player. For in India, where music has never been
committed to writing, but is an affair of tradition
tempered by personal inspiration, the part of the
interpreter is more important even than with us.
Of European music even a bad player can give us
some idea; and those who have acquired the art
of reading a score can get their musical pleasure
through the eye alone. Not so in India. Here
the performer is all-important. He is everything;
not only the interpreter, but also the repository
and publisher of music—Breitkopf and Hartel as
well as Paganini; not only the guardian of ancient
tradition, but also the inspired improvisatore. The
bad performer can give you nothing of Indian
music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Lahore, we were fortunate in hearing a most
accomplished performer on the sitar or Indian
lute. He was a middle-aged man with a walrus
moustache and an explosion of most musical long
hair, in the centre of which he wore a red plush
cap embroidered with gold. He looked, I thought,
like a reproduction in brown of an old-fashioned
German pianist. But how humble, in comparison
with the lordly artists of Europe, how very definitely
an inferior the poor man was! He sat on
the floor awaiting our good pleasure, played when
he was told, stopped at a word in the middle of
a musical phrase, played on uncomplainingly
through our conversation. Music in India has
strangely come down in the world. From being,
it is said, the accomplishment of princesses, it has
come to be the monopoly of prostitutes. Courtesans
are the only professional female musicians in
India, and very many of the male professionals
are only the hereditary teachers of courtesans.
Our musician had climbed a little way above his
congenital station in life; he gave lessons to amateurs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sitar is a long-necked guitar, bellied with
the half of a bisected pumpkin (and having, sometimes,
the second half attached like a goitre to its
neck), wire-strung, and played with a plectrum.
From this lute a skilled musician can draw an
extraordinary variety of sounds—from sharp staccato
to notes long-drawn, as though produced by
a bow; from clear, full, ringing sounds to a whining
slither through fractions of a tone; from
loudly martial to sweet and tender. The melody is
played only on the first string, the remaining wires
(tuned to sound the dominant, in various octaves,
of the key to whose tonic the first string is tuned)
being used to produce the accompanying drone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our lutanist’s repertory was large, and he was
prepared to play anything we asked for. Folk-songs
in the pentatonic black-note scale—first
cousins, these, to what we are accustomed to regard
as characteristically Scottish airs—were followed
by classical pieces, in which the most
elaborate variations were embroidered on themes
that sounded now Gregorian, now like a rambling
and, to our ears, rather tuneless Western folk-song.
We heard specimens of the music that is supposed
to be played only in the morning, and specimens
of that which is intended for the night. We heard
the delightful song that is meant to be sung in
cloudy weather. We heard the snake-charmer’s
music, built up round a most snaky phrase of descending
semi-tones, and the camel-driver’s song,
wailing and romantic. Generally the instrument
sounded alone. But sometimes the minstrel lifted
his shaggy head and gave vent to shrill tenor notes,
neighed out from somewhere between the nose and
the upper gullet. Strange sounds, and to our ears
somewhat ludicrous, particularly when taken in
conjunction with certain nods and vibrations of
the head, certain almost girlishly coquettish gestures
made with a hand that was lifted for the
purpose from the sounding strings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was able to understand and appreciate the
music tolerably well. All of it, that is, except the
music played, traditionally, when a man gives up
the world for the life of meditation. One of these
renunciatory pieces—a most elaborate, classical
affair—was played for our benefit. But I must
confess that, listen as I might, I was unable to hear
anything particularly mournful or serious, anything
specially suggestive of self-sacrifice in the
piece. To my Western ears it sounded much more
cheerful than the dance which followed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emotions are everywhere the same; but the
artistic expression of them varies from age to age
and from one country to another. We are brought
up to accept the conventions current in the society
into which we are born. This sort of art, we learn
in childhood, is meant to excite laughter, that to
evoke our tears. Such conventions vary with great
rapidity, even in the same country. There are
Elizabethan dances that sound as melancholy to
our ears as little funeral marches. Conversely, we
are made to laugh by the “Anglo-Saxon attitudes”
of the holiest personages in the drawings and miniatures
of earlier centuries. Only with the aid of
a historically trained imagination can we see or
hear as our ancestors heard or saw. Remoteness
in space divides no less than remoteness in time,
and to the untrained auditor or spectator the artistic
conventions of strangers are as little comprehensible
as those of his own fathers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is in the visual arts that the conventions for
the expression of emotions vary most widely. This
is due, I suppose, to two main causes, of a character
respectively physiological and intellectual.
Form and colour have very little direct physiological
effect upon the perceiving organism.
Sounds, on the other hand, act directly on the
nerves and can stimulate, exasperate, daze, bemuse,
as forms and colours can never do. Certain
types of rhythmical sounds produce certain
almost specific effects upon the nervous system.
It is obvious that in forming his conventions of
expressions the musician must take into account
these specific physiological effects of sound. Drumbeats
and loud brassy notes sounded in regular,
even time are specifically exciting; it therefore follows
that the convention for expressing the martial
emotions can never involve slow croonings of violins
in an undulating three-four time, or elaborate
bird-like warblings on the flute. Thus it comes
about that there is a certain family likeness common
to the conventions of expression of every system
of music—a family likeness which does not
exist among the conventions of the various systems
of pictorial art. But even in music the differences
between the conventions of expression are very
great. Music affects us physiologically through
rhythm and the volume and quality of sounds.
Conventions, which we have come to regard as
fundamental, but which do not involve these particular
factors, are found, when we compare them
with the conventions of other systems, to be purely
arbitrary. Thus, what we regard as the fundamental
difference between major and minor keys—the
minor being for us essentially melancholy—is
not fundamental at all, but the result of a recent
and arbitrary convention of Western musicians.
Before the seventeenth century the convention did
not exist even in European music, and in Oriental
music it is not thought of, the most cheerful, jolly,
and martial music being pitched in the minor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So much for physiology. There are other and
purely intellectual reasons why the conventions of
expression should vary more widely in the different
systems of visual art than they do in the systems
of music. The visual arts lend themselves to storytelling
and the symbolical exposition of philosophical
theories and religious dogmas. Music does not.
Thus, to Western eyes, the picture of a man with
four arms, an elephant’s head, and a lotus growing
out of his navel seems grotesque. But an orthodox
Hindu would see nothing comical in it. To us
pictures of monsters and impossible hybrids are by
convention, funny. To him they are symbolical
of the highest truths.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>AMRITSAR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Golden Temple of the Sikhs is genuinely
eighteen carat. It is also exceedingly sacred.
Holiness and costliness make up for any lack of
architectural merit. For architecturally the temple
is less than nothing. We went in bare-footed—the
Sikhs insist on this sign of respect. Picking
our way among the bird droppings and expectorated
betel that strewed the causeway, we advanced
gingerly towards the most golden and holiest of
the shrines which stands islanded in the middle of
the sacred tank. In the holy of holies three magnificent
old men were chanting ecstatically to the
accompaniment of a small portable harmonium,
which was being played with one finger by a
fourth, yet more superbly patriarchal. We listened
with reverence, were offered by the verger some
sugar-plums—symbolical, no doubt, of something—deposited
an alms and retraced our squeamish
steps along the causeway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the street a young beggar, half-witted, or
feigning imbecility, pursued us, pitiably moaning
as though he were being tortured. Bearded Akalis
passed us carrying their swords. A group of male
prostitutes, painted, jewelled, and dressed like
women, loitered at a street corner. We turned
down a narrow passage and found ourselves in the
Jalianwalla Bagh, the scene of General Dyer’s exploits
in 1919. It is a piece of waste ground enclosed
by walls and houses. The narrow passage
down which we had come appeared to be the only
entrance. A bad place for a crowd to be caught
and fired on with machine-guns. One could kill
more people here, and in a shorter time, than in
most plots of ground of equal area. General Dyer
proved it experimentally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dyer’s reversion to the old-fashioned methods
of Aurangzeb evoked a good deal of unfriendly
comment at home. It was found shocking and
un-English. At the same time, it had to be admitted
that his ruthlessness had achieved what it
had been intended to achieve. It put a stop to
what might have turned into a revolution. The
blood of the martyrs is by no means invariably the
seed of the church. The victims of the Inquisition
died in vain; Protestantism disappeared from
Spain as completely as the Albigensian faith from
Southern France, or as Christianity from North
Africa. Persecution can always succeed, provided
that it is sufficiently violent and long-drawn. The
Romans persecuted feebly and by fits—enough to
stimulate the persecuted to fresh efforts, but not
enough to destroy them; enough to arouse sympathy
for their victims, but not enough to deter
the sympathisers. That was why the blood of the
early Christian martyrs was indeed the seed of
their church. If the Romans had been as systematically
ruthless as the Christians were to show
themselves in future centuries, the infant church
could never have survived. Anybody who has the
power and is prepared to go on using it indefinitely
and without compunction, can force his will on the
whole world. It is obvious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was rarely in the past that any one possessed
of power showed himself in the least reluctant to
use it to the full. If the Romans failed to persecute
Christianity with an adequate ferocity, that
was due to their failure to realise its anti-Imperial
significance, not to any conscientious dislike to violent
persecution as such. Things are different now,
at any rate in the West. Men have become reluctant
to use their power to the full, to carry
authority to its logical conclusion in brute force.
Those who possessed power have voluntarily abstained
from making full use of it, have even deprived
themselves of their power for the benefit
of the powerless. Oligarchs have granted privileges
to the disinherited; industrialists have passed
laws to restrain themselves from exploiting to excess
their workmen. Instead of shooting their
unwilling subjects wholesale, the owners of colonies
have dealt out constitutions. The criminal is
no longer cruelly punished, and even the domestic
animal is now legally protected from the violences
of its human master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Living as we do in the midst of this historical
process, which we vaguely call “the humanitarian
movement,” we are unable to realise the strangeness
and fundamental novelty of it. Tennyson
warned us against “the craven fear of being great”
(at other people’s expense); but the craven fear
has gone on steadily growing, in spite of him.
What seems to us extraordinary to-day is not some
symptom of reluctance to use power but its ruthless,
full, and unhesitating employment. We are
amazed, not by President Wilson, but by Mussolini;
not by Chelmsford and Montague, but by
Dyer. At any other period of the world’s history
than this, Dyer and Mussolini would have seemed
the normal ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Europe the new feelings about force and
power have gradually grown up, the new policy
which is the result of them has been developed by
degrees. We have been brought up with them;
they seem natural to us. We are too familiar with
them to realise them. The anti-democratic reaction
in Italy and Spain and Russia has made many
of us for the first time acutely conscious of these
humanitarian feelings, has rendered the nature of
this democratic policy explicitly clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nowhere is the contrast between old and new
more striking than in India. For humanitarian
feelings are not native to the Indian soil. The life
of a cow, it is true, is respected, but not the life of
a man. Humanitarian feelings with regard to men
have been introduced artificially, from outside.
And the democratic system of policy in which these
feelings normally result has been grafted suddenly
on another system, whose general benevolence of
intention made it none the less despotic. Old and
new strangely co-exist, and India is ruled in accordance
with two completely incompatible theories of
government: that of Akbar, shall we say, and that
of Woodrow Wilson. On Monday the watchword
of the Executive is “Reform and Responsible
Self-Government”; like Oliver Twist, the Indians
immediately ask for more; their demands become
alarmingly insistent, and the Government nervously
decides to be firm. On Tuesday some General Dyer
rivals the exploits of the Moguls; repressive legislation
is passed, the gaols are crowded. On
Wednesday the Government is seized with conscientious
qualms; remembering what Mr. Gladstone
said in 1882 and why the Great War was
fought, it makes a “generous gesture.” The response
is so unenthusiastic that it becomes necessary
on Thursday to suspend the Habeas Corpus
Act and imprison several thousand suspects without
a trial. By the end of the week, everybody,
including the Government itself, is feeling rather
muddled. And what about next week, and the
week after that, and all the other weeks that are
to follow?</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>AGRA</h2>

<p class='pindent'>I am always a little uncomfortable when I find
myself unable to admire something which all
the rest of the world admires—or at least is reputed
to admire. Am I, or is the world the fool?
Is it the world’s taste that is bad, or is mine? I am
reluctant to condemn myself, and almost equally
reluctant to believe that I alone am right. Thus,
when all men (and not the professors of English
literature only, but Milton too, but Wordsworth
and Keats) assure me that Spenser is a great poet,
I wonder what to do. For to me Spenser seems
only a virtuoso, a man with the conjuror’s tricks of
extracting perfectly rhymed stanzas by the hundred,
out of an empty mind. Perhaps I am unduly
prejudiced in favour of sense; but it has
always seemed to me that poets should have something
to say. Spenser’s is the art of saying nothing,
at length, in rhyme and rumbling metre. The
world admires; but I cannot. I wish I could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here at Agra I find myself afflicted by the same
sense of discomfort. The Taj Mahal is one of
the seven wonders. My guide assures me that it is
“perhaps the most beautiful building in the
world.” Following its advice, we drove out to
have our first look at the marvel by the light of
the setting sun. Nature did its best for the Taj.
The west was duly red, and orange, and yellow,
and, finally, emerald green, grading into pale and
flawless blue towards the zenith. Two evening
stars, Venus and Mercury, pursued the sunken
sun. The sacred Jumna was like a sheet of silver
between its banks. Beyond it the plains stretched
greyly away into the vapours of distance. The
gardens were rich with turf, with cypresses,
palms, and peepul trees, with long shadows and
rosy lights, with the noise of grasshoppers, the
calling of enormous owls, the indefatigable hammering
of a coppersmith bird. Nature, I repeat,
did its best. But though it adorned, it could not
improve the works of man. The Taj, even at sunset,
even reverberated upside down from tanks and
river, even in conjunction with melancholy cypresses—the
Taj was a disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My failure to appreciate the Taj is due, I think,
to the fact that, while I am very fond of architecture
and the decorative arts, I am very little interested
in the expensive or the picturesque, as
such and by themselves. Now the great qualities
of the Taj are precisely those of expensiveness and
picturesqueness. Milk-white amongst its dark cypresses,
flawlessly mirrored, it is positively the
<span class='it'>Toteninsel</span> of Arnold Boecklin come true. And
its costliness is fabulous. Its marbles are carved
and filigreed, are patterned with an inlay of precious
stones. The smallest rose or poppy on the
royal tombs is an affair of twenty or thirty cornelians,
onyxes, agates, chrysolites. The New
Jerusalem was not more rich in variety of precious
pebbles. If the Viceroy took it into his head to
build another Taj identical with the first, he would
have to spend as much as a fifteenth, or even perhaps
a twelfth or tenth of what he spends each
year on the Indian Army. Imagination staggers
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This inordinate costliness is what most people
seem to like about the Taj. And if they are disappointed
with it (I have met several who were,
and always for the same reason) it is because the
building is not quite so expensive as they thought
it was. Clambering among the roofs they have
found evidence to show that the marble is only a
veneer over cheaper masonry, not solid. It is a
swindle! Meanwhile the guides and guardians
are earning their money by insisting on the Taj’s
costliness. “All marble,” they say, “all precious
stones.” They want you to touch as well as look,
to realise the richness not with eyes alone, but intimately
with the fingers. I have seen guides in
Europe doing the same. Expensiveness is everywhere
admired. The average tourist is moved to
greater raptures by St. Peter’s than by his own
St. Paul’s. The interior of the Roman basilica is
all of marble. St. Paul’s is only Portland stone.
The relative architectural merits of the two
churches are not for a moment considered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Architecturally, the worst features of the Taj
are its minarets. These four thin tapering towers
standing at the four corners of the platform on
which the Taj is built are among the ugliest structures
ever erected by human hands. True, the
architect might offer a number of excuses for his
minarets. He would begin by pointing out that,
the dimensions of the main building and the platform
being what they are, it was impossible to give
the four subsidiary structures more than a certain
limited mass between them, a mass small in proportion
to the Taj itself. Architecturally, no doubt,
it would have been best to put this definitely limited
mass into four low buildings of comparatively
large plan. But unfortunately, the exigencies of
religion made it necessary to put the available
mass into minarets. This mass being small, it was
necessary that the minarets should be very thin for
their height.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These excuses, so far as they go, are perfectly
valid. By the laws of religion there had to be
minarets, and by the laws of proportion the minarets
had to be unconscionably slender. But there
was no need to make them feebly taper, there was
no need to pick out the component blocks of which
they are built with edgings of black, and above all
there was no need to surround the shaft of the
minarets with thick clumsy balconies placed, moreover,
at just the wrong intervals of distance from
one another and from the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Taj itself is marred by none of the faults
which characterise the minarets. But its elegance
is at the best of a very dry and negative kind. Its
“classicism” is the product not of intellectual restraint
imposed on an exuberant fancy, but of an
actual deficiency of fancy, a poverty of imagination.
One is struck at once by the lack of variety
in the architectural forms of which it is composed.
There are, for all practical purposes, only two
contrasting formal elements in the whole design—the
onion dome, reproduced in two dimensions in
the pointed arches of the recessed bays, and the flat
wall surface with its sharply rectangular limits.
When the Taj is compared with more or less contemporary
European buildings in the neo-classic
style of the High Renaissance and Baroque periods,
this poverty in the formal elements composing it
becomes very apparent. Consider, for example,
St. Paul’s. The number of component forms in
its design is very large. We have the hemispherical
dome, the great colonnaded cylinder of the
drum, the flat side-walls relieved by square-faced
pilasters and rounded niches; we have, at one end,
the curved surfaces of the apse and, at the other,
the West Front with its porch—a design of detached
cylinders (the pillars), seen against a flat
wall, and supporting yet another formal element,
the triangular pediment. If it is argued that St.
Paul’s is a very much larger building than the
Taj, and that we should therefore expect the number
of contrasting elements in its design to be
greater, we may take a smaller specimen of late
Renaissance architecture as our standard of comparison.
I suggest Palladio’s Rotonda at Vicenza,
a building somewhat smaller than the Taj and,
like it, of regular design and domed. Analysing
the Rotonda we shall find that it consists of a far
larger number of formal elements than does the
Taj, and that its elegance, in consequence, is much
richer, much more subtle and various than the
poor, dry, negative elegance characteristic of the
Indian building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is not necessary to go as far as Europe to
find specimens of a more varied and imaginative
elegance than that of the Taj. The Hindu architects
produced buildings incomparably more rich
and interesting as works of art. I have not visited
Southern India where, it is said, the finest specimens
of Hindu architecture are to be found. But
I have seen enough of the art in Rajputana to convince
me of its enormous superiority to any work
of the Mohammedans. The temples at Chitor, for
example, are specimens of true classicism. They
are the products of a prodigious, an almost excessive,
fancy, held in check and directed by the most
judicious intelligence. Their elegance—and in their
way they are just as elegant as the Taj—is an opulent
and subtle elegance, full of unexpected felicities.
The formal elements of their design are
numerous and pleasingly contrasted, and the detail—mouldings
and ornamental sculpture—is always,
however copious, subordinated to the architectural
scheme and of the highest decorative quality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this last respect Hindu ornament is decidedly
superior to that employed by the later Moguls.
The <span class='it'>pietra dura</span> work at the Taj and the Shahdara
tombs at Lahore is marvellously neat in execution
and of extravagant costliness. These qualities are
admirable in their way; but they have nothing to
do with the decorative value of the work considered
as art. As works of art, the <span class='it'>pietra dura</span> decorations
of the Taj are poor and uninteresting.
Arabesques of far finer design are to be seen in
the carved and painted ornamentation of Rajput
palaces and temples. As for the <span class='it'>bas reliefs</span> of
flowers which adorn the gateway of the Taj—these
are frankly bad. The design of them vacillates
uncertainly between realism and conventionalism.
They are neither life-like portraits of flowers nor
good pieces of free floral decoration. How any
one who has ever seen a fine specimen of decorative
flower-painting or flower-carving, whether
Hindu or European, can possibly admire these
feebly laborious reliefs passes my understanding.
Indeed, it seems to me that any one who professes
an ardent admiration for the Taj must look at it
without having any standards of excellence in his
mind—as though the thing existed uniquely, in a
vacuum. But the Taj exists in a world well
sprinkled with masterpieces of architecture and
decoration. Compare it with these, and the Imperial
Mausoleum at once takes its proper place in
the hierarchy of art—well down below the best.
But it is made of marble. Marble, I perceive, covers
a multitude of sins.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>FATEHPUR SIKRI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Akbar built the city as a small personal tribute
to himself. The vanity of Indian potentates
had a way of running to brand new cities. Witness
Jai Singh’s Jaipur, five miles from the existing
and perfectly satisfactory town of Amber; Jodha’s
Jodhpur, an hour’s walk from Mandor; the Udaipur
of Udai Singh next door to Arh. An expensive
form of royal vanity; but one for which the
modern tourist should be grateful. There is nothing
more picturesque than a deserted city, nothing
more mournfully romantic. These deserted cities
of Northern India are particularly romantic because,
being relatively modern, they are all in an
excellent state of preservation. For a building that
is intact, but deserted, is much more romantic,
more picturesquely melancholy than a deserted
ruin. One expects a ruin to be deserted; nobody, it
is obvious, could possibly live in Pompeii, or among
the roofless remains of an English abbey. But in
a building that is intact one expects to find inhabitants.
When such a building is deserted, we are
mournfully surprised; and the contrast between its
emptiness and intactness strikes us as being strange
and suggestive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fatehpur is less than four hundred years old,
and, so far as the principal buildings are concerned,
it is in a state of perfect preservation. The
red sandstone which Akbar used in the building
of his city is a hard, weather-resisting rock. The
sculpture, the mouldings are still clean-edged and
sharp. There has been no blurring of outlines, no
crumbling, no leprous decay. Akbar’s red city
stands to-day in the condition in which he left it—and
stands empty, untenanted even by the monkeys
which inhabit so many of India’s deserted palaces
and temples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To those whom the dry and sterile elegance of
Shah Jahan’s Agra has left unsatisfied, the architecture
of Fatehpur Sikri will seem refreshing. For
the greatest of the alien Mohammedan emperors
was a patron of the indigenous Hindu art of India,
and the architecture of his capital is marked by
something of the genuine Hindu vigour and wealth
of imagination. The <span class='it'>liwan</span> or covered portion of
the mosque is particularly fine. It is divided up
into three square chambers, in line and communicating;
and the characteristically Hindu ceilings
of these chambers are supported by a number of
very tall Hindu columns. The building is superb
in proportion and detail, and is certainly one of
the finest pieces of interior architecture on a large
scale to be seen in Upper India. And yet, such is
the prestige of expensive material that poor uninteresting
buildings, wholly lacking in grandeur or
originality, like the Pearl Mosque at Agra, the
pavilions by the lake at Ajmere, are much more
widely celebrated. They are of marble; Fatehpur
is only of sandstone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late in the afternoon when we left the
deserted city. The walls and domes glowed more
rosily than ever in the light of the almost level sun.
It had become a city of coral. There was a screaming
in the air above us. Looking up we saw a
flock of parrots flying across the pale sky. The
shadow of the enormous Gate of Victory was upon
them; but a moment later they emerged from it
into the bright transfiguring sunlight. Over the
courts of that deserted city of coral and ruddy gold
a flight of emerald birds passed glittering and was
gone.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>JAIPUR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Jaipur did not casually grow; it was made. Its
streets are broad and straight, and intersect one
another at right angles, like the streets of Turin
or of some American city. The houses are all
bright pink, and look like those charming and
curiously improbable pieces of architecture in the
backgrounds of Italian primitives. It is an orthodox
and pious town. The pavements are thronged
with ruminating bulls and Brahmins and fakirs;
the shops do a thriving trade in phallic symbols,
of which the manufacture, in gilt and painted marble,
seems to be one of the staple industries of the
place. In the streets men ride on horses, on enormous
camels; or are driven in ancient victorias, in
still more extraordinary four-wheelers that look
like sections cut out of third-class railway coaches,
or, most often, in little carts with domed canopies
and (if the occupants happen to be ladies) concealing
curtains, drawn by smart pairs of trotting
bullocks, whose horns are painted green. Only
the women of the people are visible in the streets.
They move with the princely grace of those who,
with pots and baskets on their heads, have passed
their lives in practising the deportment of queens.
Their full skirts swing as they walk, and at every
step the heavy brass bangles at their feet make a
loud and, oh!—for this is India—a mournfully
symbolical clanking as of fetters.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>JAIPUR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At Jaipur we were fortunate in having an introduction
to one of the great <span class='it'>thakurs</span> of the
State. He was a mighty land holder, the owner
of twenty villages with populations ranging from
five hundred to as many thousands, a feudal lord
who paid for his fief (until, a year or two ago, a
somewhat simpler and more modern system of
tenure was introduced) by contributing to the State
army one hundred and fifty armed and mounted
men. This nobleman was kind enough to place
his elephant at our disposal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a superb and particularly lofty specimen,
with gold-mounted tusks; ate two hundredweights
of food a day and must have cost at least six hundred
a year to keep. An expensive pet. But for a
man in the <span class='it'>thakur’s</span> position, we gathered, indispensable,
a necessity. Pachyderms in Rajputana
are what glass coaches were in Europe a century
and a half ago—essential luxuries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>thakur</span> was a charming and cultured man,
hospitably kind as only Indians can be. But at the
risk of seeming ungrateful, I must confess, that, of
all the animals I have ever ridden, the elephant is
the most uncomfortable mount. On the level, it is
true, the motion is not too bad. One seems to be
riding on a small chronic earthquake; that is all.
The earthquake becomes more disquieting when
the beast begins to climb. But when it goes downhill,
it is like the end of the world. The animal
descends very slowly and with an infinite caution,
planting one huge foot deliberately before the
other, and giving you time between each calculated
step to anticipate the next convulsive spasm
of movement—a spasm that seems to loosen from
its place every organ in the rider’s body, that twists
the spine, that wrenches all the separate muscles
of the loins and thorax. The hills round Jaipur
are not very high. Fortunately; for by the end of
the three or four hundred feet of our climbing
and descending, we had almost reached the limits
of our endurance. I returned full of admiration
for Hannibal. He crossed the Alps on an elephant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We made two expeditions with the pachyderm;
one—over a rocky pass entailing, there and back,
two climbs and two sickening descents—to the
tanks and ruined temples of Galta, and one to the
deserted palaces of Amber. Emerging from the
palace precincts—I record the trivial and all too
homely incident, because it set me mournfully reflecting
about the cosmos—our monster halted and,
with its usual deliberation, relieved nature, portentously.
Hardly, the operation over, had it resumed
its march when an old woman who had
been standing at the door of a hovel among the
ruins, expectantly waiting—we had wondered for
what—darted forward and fairly threw herself on
the mound of steaming excrement. There was fuel
here, I suppose, for a week’s cooking. “Salaam,
Maharaj,” she called up to us, bestowing in her
gratitude the most opulent title she could lay her
tongue to. Our passage had been to her like a
sudden and unexpected fall of manna. She
thanked us, she blessed the great and charitable
Jumbo for his Gargantuan bounty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our earthquake lurched on. I thought of the
scores of millions of human beings to whom the
passage of an unconstipated elephant seems a godsend,
a stroke of enormous good luck. The thought
depressed me. Why are we here, men and women,
eighteen hundred millions of us, on this remarkable
and perhaps unique planet? To what end?
Is it to go about looking for dung—cow dung,
horse dung, the enormous and princely excrement
of elephants? Evidently it is—for a good many
of us at any rate. It seemed an inadequate reason,
I thought, for our being here—immortal souls,
first cousins of the angels, own brothers of Buddha
and Mozart and Sir Isaac Newton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a little while later I saw that I was wrong
to let the consideration depress me. If it depressed
me, that was only because I looked at the whole
matter from the wrong end, so to speak. In painting
my mental picture of the dung-searchers I had
filled my foreground with the figures of Sir Isaac
Newton and the rest of them. These, I perceived,
should have been relegated to the remote background
and the foreground should have been filled
with cows and elephants. The picture so arranged,
I should have been able to form a more philosophical
and proportionable estimate of the dung-searchers.
For I should have seen at a glance
how vastly superior were their activities to those
of the animal producers of dung in the foreground.
The philosophical Martian would admire the
dung-searchers for having discovered a use for
dung; no other animal, he would point out, has
had the wit to do more than manufacture it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are not Martians and our training makes us
reluctant to think of ourselves as animals. Nobody
inquires why cows and elephants inhabit the world.
There is as little <span class='it'>reason</span> why we should be here,
eating, drinking, sleeping, and in the intervals
reading metaphysics, saying prayers, or collecting
dung. We <span class='it'>are</span> here, that is all; and like other
animals we do what our native capacities and our
environment permit of our doing. Our achievement,
when we compare it with that of cows and
elephants, is remarkable. They automatically
make dung; we collect it and turn it into fuel. It
is not something to be depressed about; it is something
to be proud of. Still, in spite of the consolations
of philosophy, I remained pensive.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>JAIPUR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>There is a mirror room in the fort at Agra;
there are others in almost all the palaces of
Rajputana. But the prettiest of them all are the
mirror rooms in the palace of Amber. Indeed, I
never remember to have seen mirrors anywhere
put to better decorative use than here, in this deserted
Rajput palace of the seventeenth century.
There are no large sheets of glass at Amber; there
is no room for large sheets. A bold and elegant
design in raised plaster work covers the walls and
ceiling; the mirrors are small and shaped to fit
into the interstices of the plaster pattern. Like
all old mirrors they are grey and rather dim.
Looking into them you see “in a glass, darkly.”
They do not portray the world with that glaring
realism which characterises the reverberations of
modern mirrors. But their greatest charm is that
they are slightly convex, so that every piece gives
back its own small particular image of the world
and each, when the shutters are opened, or a candle
is lit, has a glint in its grey surface like the curved
high-light in an eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They are wonderfully rich, these mirror rooms
at Amber. Their elaborateness surpasses that even
of the famous mirror room at Bagheria, near
Palermo. But whereas the Sicilian room is nothing
more than the old-fashioned glass-and-gilding
merry-go-round made stationary, the Indian rooms
are a marvel of cool and elegant refinement. True,
this form of decoration does not lend itself to the
adornment of large areas of wall or ceiling; it is
too intricate for that. But fortunately the rooms
in Indian palaces are seldom large. In a country
where it rains with a punctual regularity and only
at one season of the year, large rooms of assembly
are unnecessary. Crowds are accommodated and
ceremonials of state performed more conveniently
out of doors than in. The Hall of Audience in
an Indian palace is a small pillared pavilion placed
at one end of an open courtyard. The king sat in
the pavilion, his courtiers and petitioners thronged
the open space. Every room in the palace was a
private room, a place of intimacy. One must not
come to India expecting to find grandiose specimens
of interior architecture. There are no long
colonnaded vistas, no galleries receding interminably
according to all the laws of perspective, no
colossal staircases, no vaults so high that at night
the lamplight can hardly reach them. Here in
India, there are only small rooms adorned with the
elaborate decoration that is meant to be looked at
from close to and in detail. Such are the mirror
rooms at Amber.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BIKANER</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The desert of Rajputana is a kind of Sahara
but smaller and without oases. Travelling
across it, one looks out over plains of brown dust.
Once in every ten or twenty yards, some grey-green
plant, deep-rooted, and too thorny for even camels
to eat, tenaciously, and with a kind of desperate
vegetable ferocity, struggles for life. And at
longer intervals, draining the moisture of a rood
of land, there rise, here and there, the little stunted
trees of the desert. From close at hand the sparseness
of their distantly scattered growth is manifest.
But seen in depth down the long perspective of
receding distance, they seem—like the in fact remotely
scattered stars of the Milky Way—numerous
and densely packed. Close at hand the desert
is only rarely flecked by shade; but the further
distances seem flecked with a dense dark growth of
trees. The foreground is always desert, but on
every horizon there is the semblance of shadowy
forests. The train rolls on, and the forests remain
for ever on the horizon; around one is always and
only the desert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bikaner is the metropolis of this desert, a great
town islanded in the sand. The streets are unpaved,
but clean. The sand of which they are
made desiccates and drinks up every impurity that
falls upon it. And what astonishing houses flank
these streets! Huge <span class='it'>palazzi</span> of red sandstone,
carved and fretted from basement to attic, their
blank walls—wherever a wall has been left blank—whitewashed
and painted with garishly ingenuous
modern frescoes of horses, of battles, of trains
running over bridges, of ships. These houses, the
like of which we had seen in no other city, are the
palaces of the Marwari merchants, the Jews of India,
who go forth from their desert into the great
towns, whence they return with the fruits of their
business ability to their native place. Some of
them are said to be fabulously wealthy, and Bikaner
has, I suppose, more millionaires per thousand
of population than any other town in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were shown over the country villa of one
of these plutocrats, built in the desert a mile or
two beyond the city wall. Costly and unflagging
labour had created and conserved in the teeth of
the sand, the scorching wind of summer and the
winter frosts, a garden of trees and lawns, of
roses and English vegetables. It is the marvel
of Bikaner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was setting as we reached the bungalow.
A little army of coolies was engaged in covering
the lawns with tarpaulin sheets and fitting canvas
greatcoats on all the shrubs. The night frosts are
dangerous at this season. In summer, on the other
hand, it is by day that the verdure must be jacketted.
Such is horticulture in Rajputana.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had hoped, too optimistically, to find in the
Marwari plutocrats the modern equivalents of the
Florentine merchant-princes of the <span class='it'>quattrocento</span>.
But this pleasing bubble of illusion burst, with
an almost audible pop, as we passed from the millionaire’s
garden into his house. The principal
drawing-room was furnished almost exclusively
with those polychromatic <span class='it'>art nouveau</span> busts that
issue from the workshops of the tombstone manufacturers
of Carrara, and with clockwork toys.
These last had all been set going, simultaneously,
in our honour. A confused ticking and clicking
filled the air, and wherever we looked our eyes
were dizzied by movement. Tigers, almost life
size, nodded their heads. Pink <span class='it'>papier-mâché</span>
pigs opened and shut their mouths. Clocks in the
form of negroes rolled their eyes; in the form of
fox-terriers wagged their tails and, opening their
jaws to bark, uttered a tick; in the form of donkeys
agitated their long ears sixty times a minute. And,
preciously covered by a glass dome, a porcelain
doll, dressed in the Paris fashions of 1900, jerkily
applied a powder-puff to its nose, and jerkily
reached back to the powder-box—again and again.
These, evidently, are the products of our Western
civilisation which the East really admires. I remembered
a certain brooch which I had seen one
evening, at a dinner party, on the <span class='it'>sari</span> of an Indian
lady of great wealth and the highest position—a
brooch consisting of a disc of blue enamel surrounded
by diamonds, on the face of which two
large brilliants revolved, by clockwork, in concentric
circles and opposite directions. It was an
eight-day brooch, I learned, wound every Sunday
night.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BIKANER</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In the desert, five miles out of Bikaner, stands a
city of tombs, the cenotaphs of the Maharajas
and their royal kindred. They are to be counted
by scores and hundreds—little white domes
perched on pillars, or covering cells of masonry.
Under each dome a little slab bears the name of
the commemorated dead. In the older tombs these
slabs are carved with crude reliefs representing
the prince, sometimes on horseback, sometimes sitting
on his throne, accompanied by as many of his
wives and concubines as burnt themselves to death
on his funeral pyre. Few of these Maharajas of
an earlier generation left the world without taking
with them two or three unfortunate women.
Some of them were accompanied to the fire by
six, seven, and in one case, I counted even nine victims.
On the slab their images form a little frieze
below the image of their lord and master—a row of
small identical figures stretching across the stone.
Nine luscious Hindu beauties, deep-bosomed,
small-waisted, sumptuously haunched—their portraits
are deliciously amusing. But looking at
them, I could not help remembering the dreadful
thing these little sculptures commemorated. I
thought of the minutes of torment that ushered
them out of life into this comical world of art
which they now inhabit, under the weather-stained
domes in the desert. Every here and there stands
a tomb on whose central slab is carved a small
conventional pair of feet. These are the feet of
those royal ladies who, for one reason or another,
did not commit <span class='it'>sati</span>. Each time I saw a pair of
these marble feet I felt like calling for cheers.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>JODHPUR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Standing on the ramparts of the Jodhpur
fort—on a level with the highest wheelings of
the vultures, whose nests are on the ledges of the
precipices beneath the walls—one looks down on
to the roofs of the city, hundreds of feet below.
And every noise from the streets and houses comes
floating up, diminished but incredibly definite and
clear, a multitudinous chorus, in which, however,
one can distinguish all the separate component
sounds—crying and laughter, articulate speech,
brayings and bellowings and bleatings, the creak
and rumble of wheels, the hoarse hooting of a
conch, the pulsing of drums. I have stood on high
places above many cities, but never on one from
which the separate sounds making up the great
counterpoint of a city’s roaring could be so clearly
heard, so precisely sifted by the listening ear.
From the bastions of Jodhpur Fort one hears as
the gods must hear from their Olympus—the gods
to whom each separate word uttered in the innumerably
peopled world below comes up distinct
and individual to be recorded in the books of
omniscience.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>JODHPUR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was late in the afternoon when we drove past
the Courts of Justice. The day’s business was
over and the sweepers were at work, making clean
for the morrow. Outside one of the doors of the
building stood a row of brimming waste-paper
baskets, and from these, as from mangers, two
or three sacred bulls were slowly and majestically
feeding. When the baskets were empty officious
hands from within replenished them with a fresh
supply of torn and scribbled paper. The bulls
browsed on; it was a literary feast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Watching them at their meal, I understood why
it is that Indian bulls are so strangely mild. On
a diet of waste-paper, it would be difficult for them
to be anything but disciples of Gandhi, devotees
of non-violence and <span class='it'>ahimsa</span>. I also understood
why it is that Indian cows yield so little milk and,
further, why the cattle of either sex are so often
afflicted with hiccoughs. Before I came to India,
I had never heard a bull hiccoughing. It is a loud
and terrifying sound. Hearing behind me that explosive
combination of a bellow and a bark, I
have often started in alarm, thinking I was on the
point of being attacked. But looking round, I
would find that it was only one of the mild, dyspeptic
totems of the Hindus, gorged with waste-paper
and painfully, uncontrollably belching as it
walked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The effects on horses of a certainly insufficient
and probably also unnatural diet are different.
They do not hiccough—at least I never heard them
hiccoughing. But as they trot the withered and
emptily sagging entrails in their bellies give forth,
at every step, a strange sound like the leathery
creaking of organ bellows. It is a most distressing
sound, but one to which all those who drive in Indian
tongas must learn to accustom themselves.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>JODHPUR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At the time when the question of putting an end
to the East India Company’s monopoly was
under discussion there were several distinguished
English administrators who argued that, quite
apart from all considerations of commercial interests,
it would be highly impolitic to open the country
freely to European immigration. So far from
strengthening the Company’s position, they argued,
the influx of Europeans would actually weaken
and imperil it. For the inflowing Europeans would
be commercial adventurers of no breeding or education.
Now the low, when exalted by circumstances,
are generally tyrannous, and the uneducated
are incapable of seeing beyond the circle of
their own native prejudices. In India circumstances
conspire to exalt every member of the ruling
race, really to some extent as well as in his
own estimation. Nor is there any country in which
it is more necessary to respect and make allowances
for unfamiliar prejudices. Wittingly, by
deliberate insult, unwittingly, by failing to allow
for foreign prejudices, the low and uneducated
may exasperate a subject people to whom the dominion
of rulers no less foreign and in essentials
no less rapacious and oppressive, but courteous and
in small matters tolerant, seems comparatively unobjectionable.
Open India to free European immigration
and you admit into the land the potential
causes of racial hatred and political unrest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was thus that the defenders of the Company’s
monopoly argued, generations ago. The case was
decided against them—inevitably. It was impossible
to keep India a closed country. But the
supporters of lost causes are not necessarily fools.
The opponents of free immigration exaggerated
its dangers. But the briefest visit to India is
enough to convince one that there was much truth
in what they said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the Jodhpur Dak Bungalow, to which, the
Guest House being full, we had been relegated,
I was reminded, as I had often been reminded
before, of their warnings. The reminder was
more forcible than usual, since the person who
reminded me was more frightfully typical of the
class it was desired to exclude than any one I had
hitherto met. He was ill-bred and totally uncultured;
prosperous, having evidently come up
in the world, and in consequence bumptious and
hectoring with all the vulgar insolence of the low
man exalted and anxious to remind other people
and himself of his newly acquired importance.
Towards his fellow Europeans the man’s inferiority
complex expressed itself in boastings; but
where the Indians were concerned, it found vent,
towards the poor, in bullying, towards those who
looked rich enough to be able to claim the protection
of the law, in insult and rudeness. Uneducated,
the manifest descendant of pork butchers
and publicans, he felt himself immeasurably superior
to every inhabitant of the peninsula, from
the Rajput prince to the pandit and the Europeanised
doctor of science. He was a white man—“one
of the whitest men unhung.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of some thousands of miles of
travelling in Upper India, involving many halts at
station restaurants and Dak Bungalows, it was our
misfortune to meet a good many men of this type.
The Jodhpur specimen was certainly the worst,
but all were bad. And all belonged to the lower
orders of the unofficial, trading community.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The official class in India is composed of men
of decent family, decently brought up and, as education
goes, well-educated. They are consequently
tolerant and well-behaved. For the educated man
is capable of looking at things from other points of
view than his own. And one who has been brought
up in the ruling classes of society is generally courteous,
not because he does not feel himself superior
to other people, but precisely because his sense of
superiority is so great that he feels that he owes it
to his inferiors to be civil to them as a slight compensation
for their manifest inferiority. In social
intercourse it is the acts that count, not the motives
behind them. The courtesy of a duke or of a royal
personage charms us, and we do not reflect that it
is due to a contempt for ourselves far more crushing
than that which the parvenu offensively expresses
for his menials and tradesmen. The blustering
rudeness of the parvenu is an admission of
the precariousness of his superiority. The prince
is so contemptuously certain of his, that he can
afford to be civil. But civility, whatever its cause,
is always civility; and rudeness angers and hurts
us, even when we know it to be the expression of
the sense of inferiority. The official may be courteous
only because he is inwardly convinced of his
enormous superiority to the Indians with whom he
comes in contact; but at any rate he is courteous,
and courtesy never offends. Indians may regard
the official’s rule as an injury to the country; but
at least he refrains, generally speaking, from adding
personal insult. Insult comes mainly from insignificant
non-officials; it makes more enemies to
English rule than official injury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Most Englishmen who live in India will tell
you that they love the Indians. For peasants, for
workmen, for sepoys, for servants they feel nothing
but a benevolent and fatherly affection. They
greatly admire the orthodox Brahmin who thinks
it wrong to cross the seas and whose learning is
all mythology, Sanskrit, and a fabulous kind of
history. Still greater is their admiration for the
Rajput noble, that picturesque survival from the
age of chivalry; he rides well, plays a good game
of tennis, and is in every respect a pukka sahib—that
is to say, a sportsman with good manners, a
code of morals not vastly different from that current
at English public schools, and no intellectual
accomplishments or pretensions. The only Indians
you find them objecting to as a class are those who
have received a Western education. The reason
is sufficiently obvious. The educated Indian is the
Englishman’s rival and would-be supplanter. To
the slavish and illiterate masses the European is
manifestly superior. Nor can the pandit, entangled
in his orthodoxy and learned only in Sanskrit,
the sporting nobleman, learned in nothing,
ever challenge a supremacy which he owes to his
Western training. All these he can afford to love,
protectively. But no man loves another who
threatens to deprive him of his privileges and
powers. The educated Indian is not popular with
the Europeans. It is only to be expected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This dislike of the educated Indian is frequently
expressed by the low European in terms of gross
or covert insult. No man likes to be insulted, even
by those whom he despises. Philosophers will
wince at the sarcasms of passing street boys and
the unfavourable comments of critics, infinitely
their inferiors, have wounded to the quick the
greatest artists. It is not to be wondered at if men,
who are neither sages nor geniuses and who, moreover,
have been brought up in the humiliating
position of members of a subject race, should be
quick to resent insults. The hatred of the educated
middle class—in India, at the present time, largely
unemployed and consequently embittered—is a
menace to any government. In the creation of this
hatred the worst bred and least educated of the
Europeans have done more than their fair share.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>AJMERE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The little grandson of the Indian house, into
which a letter of introduction had admitted
us, was a child of about eight or nine, beautiful
with that pure, grave, sensitive beauty, which belongs
only to children. In one of his books, I
forget which, Benjamin Kidd has made some very
judicious reflections on the beauty of children.
The beauty of children, he points out, is almost a
superhuman beauty. We are like angels when we
are children—candid, innocently passionate, disinterestedly
intelligent. The angelic qualities of
our minds express themselves in our faces. In
youth and earliest maturity we are human; the
angel dies and we are men. Greek art, it is significant,
is preoccupied almost exclusively with youth.
As middle age advances, we become less and less
human, increasingly simian. Some remain ape-like
to the end. Some, with the fading of the
body’s energies and appetites, become for a second
time something more than human—the Ancients
of Mr. Shaw’s fable—personified mind.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>AJMERE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>To see things—really to see them—one must use
the legs as well as the eyes. Even a vicarious
muscular effort quickens the vision; and a country
that is looked at from horseback or a carriage, is
seen almost as completely and intimately as one
through which the spectator has walked on his
own feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there is another kind of sight-seeing, admittedly
less adequate than the first, but in its own
peculiar way as delightful: the sight-seeing that
is done in comfort and without the contraction of
a muscle from a rapidly moving machine. Railways
first made it possible, to a limited extent indeed
and in somewhat disagreeable conditions.
The automobile has placed the whole world at the
mercy of the machine, and has turned high-speed
sight-seeing into a new and genuine pleasure. It
is a pleasure, indeed, which the severe moralist, if
he analysed it, if he were to determine exactly its
kind and quality, would class, I am afraid, among
the vicious pleasures; a narcotic, not an energising
pleasure; a pleasure analogous to opium-smoking;
that numbs the soul and lulls it into a passive idleness;
a pleasure of sloth and self-indulgence. I
speak as an unrepentant addict to what I must
admit to be a vice. High-speed sight-seeing induces
in me a state of being like that into which
one slides, one deliciously melts—alas, too rarely
and for all too brief a time, at a certain stage of
mild tipsiness. Sitting relaxed in the machine I
stare at the slowly shifting distances, the hurrying
fields and trees, the wildly fugitive details of the
immediate hedgerow. Plane before plane, the successive
accelerations merge into a vertiginous
counterpoint of movements. In a little while I am
dizzied into a kind of trance. Timelessly in the
passivity almost of sleep, I contemplate a spectacle
that has taken on the quality, at once unreal and
vivid, of a dream. At rest I have an illusion of
activity. Profoundly solitary, I sit in the midst
of a phantasmagoria. I have never taken the Indian
hemp, but from the depths of my trance of
speed I can divine sympathetically what must be
the pleasures of the hashish smoker, or the eater
of bhang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much less completely, but satisfyingly enough,
the movies have power to induce in me a similar
trance. Shutting my mind to the story I can concentrate
on the disembodied movement of light
and shadow on the screen, until something that
at last resembles the delicious hypnotism of speed
descends upon me and I slide into that waking
sleep of the soul, from which it is such a cruel
agony to be awakened once again into time and the
necessity of action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The long days of travelling through Rajputana
seemed to me, as I sat entranced at the window, at
once short and eternal. The journeys occupied
only as much time as it took to fall into my trance,
to eat lunch and relapse, to change trains and, once
more settled, to relapse again. The remaining
hours did not exist, and yet were longer than
thousands of years. Much passed before my eyes
and was seen; but I cannot pretend that I remember
a great deal of what I saw. And when I
do remember, it is not so much in terms of individual
objects as of processes. Innumerable separate
images, seen during hours of contemplation,
have blended and run together in my mind, to
form a single unit of memory, just as the different
phases of the growth of plants or the development
of caterpillars into butterflies are selected and
brought together by the photographer so as to be
seen as a single brief process in a five-minute cinema
film. Shutting my eyes I can revisualise, for
example, the progressive changes in colour, across
the breadth of Rajputana, of the horns of the oxen;
how they started by being painted both green, how
the green gradually melted out of one and became
red, how, later, they were both red, then both
parti-coloured, then finally striped like barber’s
poles in concentric circles of red, white and green.
More vividly still I remember a process connected
with turbans, a gradual development, the individual
phases of which must have been separately observed
here and there through hundreds of miles
of country. I remember that they started, near
Jodhpur, by being small and mostly white, that
they grew larger and larger and redder and redder
until, at a certain point where they came to a climax,
touched an apogee of grandeur, they were
like enormous balloons of dark crimson muslin
with a little brown face peeping almost irrelevantly
out of the middle of each. After that they
began to recede again from the top of their curve.
In my memory I see a process of gradual waning,
culminating at Ajmere in a return to the merely
normal. The train drew up in the midst of the
most ordinary Indian headwear. I had seen the
rise, I had been the entranced spectator of the decline
and fall of the Rajput turban. And now it
was time to alight. Reluctantly, with pain I woke
myself, I turned on lights inside my head, I
jumped into spiritual cold baths, and at length—clothed,
so to speak, and in my right mind—stepped
out of my warm delicious timelessness into
the noise and the grey squalor of Ajmere Station.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PUSHKAR LAKE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The holiest waters in India are mantled with
a green and brilliant scum. Those who
would bathe must break it, as hardy swimmers, in
our colder countries, break the ice, before they can
reach the spiritually cleansing liquid. Coming out
of the water, bathers leave behind them jagged
rifts of blackness in the green; rifts that gradually
close, if no more pilgrims come down to bathe,
till the green skin of the lake is altogether whole
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were but few bathers when we were at
Pushkar. The bathing ghats going down in flights
of white steps to the water were almost deserted
and the hundred temples all but empty. We were
able to walk easily and undisturbed along the little
stone embankments connecting ghat with ghat.
Here and there, on the lowest steps, a half-naked
man squatted, methodically wetting himself with
the scummy water, a woman, always chastely
dressed, methodically soaked her clothes. On days
of little concourse the bathers do not venture far
out into the lake. Death lurks invisible under the
green scum, swims noiselessly inshore, snaps, drags
down. We saw him basking on a little shrine-crowned
island a hundred yards from land, monstrous
and scaly, grinning even in his sleep—a
crocodile. Pushkar is so holy that no life may be
taken within its waters or on its banks, not even
the man-eater’s. A dozen pilgrims disappear each
year between those enormous jaws. It is considered
lucky to be eaten by a crocodile at Pushkar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind the ghats rises a charming architecture
of temples and priestly houses and serais for the
pilgrims—all white, with little domes against the
sky, and balconies flowering out of high blank
walls, and windows of lattice-work, and tunnelled
archways giving a glimpse, through shadow, of
sunlight beyond. Nothing very old, nothing very
grand; but all exceedingly pretty, with a certain
look of the Italian Riviera about it. Italian, too,
are the innumerable shrines—in little niches, in
ornamental sentry-boxes of stucco, under domed
canopies of stone-work. Looking into them, I
almost expected to see a mouldering plaster Crucifixion,
and Annunciation in painted terra-cotta, a
blue-robed Madonna with her Child. And it came
each time as something of a shock to discover
among the sacred shadows of the shrine a rough-hewn
cow of marble or red sandstone, kneeling
reverently before a bi-sexual phallic symbol and
gazing at it with an expression on its ingenuously
sculptured face of rapt ecstatic adoration.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHITOR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The fort of Chitor is larger than that of Jodhpur
and therefore less spectacular. The
Jodhpur fort is perched on the summit of what is
almost a crag. The hill on which Chitor is built is
probably as high, but it seems much lower, owing
to its great length; it is a ridge, not a pinnacle of
rock. And the buildings, which, at Jodhpur, are
crowded into a single imposing pile, are scattered
at wide intervals over the space enclosed within
the circuit of the walls of Chitor. Jodhpur is
wildly picturesque, like something out of a Doré
picture-book. Examined at close quarters, however,
it is not particularly interesting. From a
distance, Chitor is less imposing; but climb up
to it, and you will find it full of magnificent buildings—temples
among the finest in Upper India,
great ruined palaces, towers fantastically carved
from base to summit. None of these buildings is
much more than five hundred years old; but time
has dealt hardly with them. The soft stone of
which they are built has crumbled away under the
rain and sun and wind. The sharp edges have
become blunt, the innumerable sculptures are
blurred and defaced. The splendours of Hindu
art are only dimly seen, as though through an intervening
mist, or with myopic and unspectacled
eyes.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHITOR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Decoration is costly nowadays and money
scarce. Making a virtue of economic necessity,
we have proclaimed the beauty of unadorned
simplicity in art. In architecture, for example,
we mistrust all “fussy details,” and can admire
only the fundamental solid geometry of a building.
We like our furniture plain, our silver unchased,
our stage scenery flat and unconventional. Our
tastes will change, no doubt, when our purses grow
longer. Meanwhile, simplicity is regarded as an
almost necessary quality of good art.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the facts are against us. The best art has
not been always and necessarily the simplest. Profusion
of decorative detail need not obscure the
main lines of the composition considered as a
whole. Those who require a more convincing
proof of these statements than can be found at
home, should come to India. They will find in
the best specimens of Hindu architecture an unparalleled
extravagance of decorative details, entirely
subordinated to the main architectural
design. It would be difficult to find on the walls
of the Chitor temples a single blank square foot.
But so far from distracting the attention from the
architectural composition, the sculpture and the
ornament serve to emphasise the characteristic
forms and movements of the strange design. If
the sculpture at Chitor is unsatisfactory that is
due, not to its elaborateness and profusion, but to
its poor intrinsic quality. It is all fairly good,
but none of it is first-rate. The innumerable carvings
at Chitor are the product of a great anonymous
labour. No great original artist stands out
from among the craftsmen. It is all nameless,
unindividual.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHITOR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A visit to India makes one realise how fortunate,
so far at any rate as the arts are concerned,
our Europe has been in its religions. The
Olympian religion of antiquity and, except occasionally,
the Christianity which took its place,
were both favourable to the production of works
of art, and the art which they favoured was, on the
whole, a singularly reasonable and decent kind of
art. Neither paganism nor Christianity imposed
restrictions on what the artist might represent; nor
did either demand of him that he should try to
represent the unrepresentable. The Olympian
deities were men made gods; the Saviour of the
Christians was God made man. An artist could
work to the greater glory of Zeus or of Jesus without
ever going beyond the boundaries of real and
actual human life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How different is the state of things in India.
Here, one of the two predominant religions forbids
absolutely the representation of the human
form and even, where Muslim orthodoxy is strict,
of any living animal form whatever. It is only
occasionally and then in purely secular art and
on the smallest of scales that this religious injunction
is disobeyed. Mohammedan art tends,
in consequence, to be dry, empty, barren, and
monotonous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hinduism, on the other hand, permits the representation
of things human, but adds that the human
is not enough. It tells the artist that it is his
business to express symbolically the superhuman,
the spiritual, the pure metaphysical idea. The
best is always the enemy of the good, and by trying
to improve on sober human reality, the Hindus
have evolved a system of art full of metaphysical
monsters and grotesques that are none the less
extravagant for being symbolical of the highest
of “high” philosophies. (Too high, I may add
parenthetically, for my taste. Philosophies, like
pheasants, can be hung too long. Most of our
highest systems have been pendant for at least
two thousand years. I am plebeian enough to
prefer my spiritual nourishment fresh. But let us
return to Hindu art.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Readers of the <span class='it'>Bhagavad Gita</span> will remember
the passage in the Eleventh Discourse, where
Krishna reveals himself to Arjuna in a form
hitherto unbeheld by mortal eyes:—</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>“With mouths, eyes, arms, breasts multitudinous .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class='line'>Long-armed, with thighs and feet innumerable,</p>
<p class='line'>Vast-bosomed, set with many fearful teeth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>And further: “With many divine ornaments, with
many upraised divine weapons, wearing divine
necklaces and vestures, anointed with divine unguents,
the God all-marvellous, boundless, with
face turned every way.” And so on. The catalogue
of Krishna’s members, features and wardrobe
covers several pages of Mrs. Besant’s translation
of the <span class='it'>Gita</span>. We recognise the necessarily
inadequate embodiment of the description in innumerable
Indian statues and paintings. And
what is the significance of these grotesque and repulsive
monsters? Krishna himself explains it.
“Here to-day,” he says to Arjuna, “behold the
whole universe, movable and immovable, standing
in one in my body.” These many-limbed monsters
are symbolic, then, of the cosmos. They are the
One made manifest, the All in a nutshell. Hindu
artists are trying to express in terms of form what
can only be expressed—and not very clearly at
that, for it is difficult to speak lucidly about things
of which one knows nothing—in words. The Hindus
are too much interested in metaphysics and
ultimate Reality to make good artists. Art is not
the discovery of Reality—whatever Reality may
be, and no human being can possibly know. It
is the organisation of chaotic appearance into an
orderly and human universe.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>UDAIPUR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>By some slight error in the original introduction
which made us state guests in the various capitals
of Rajputana, I found myself credited, during
several weeks of my tour, with the title of Professor.
It was in vain that I tried to disabuse
Guest Officers and Secretaries of State. I was not
a professor; there were others of the same name.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And so on. My denials were put down to
an excessive modesty. Professor I remained to
the last. In the end I thought it best to accept the
title which had been thrust upon me. My Indian
hosts preferred me to be professor; I felt that I
could not disoblige them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the Indians of the older generation and
in the more old-fashioned parts of the country
there is a great respect for learning as such. The
scholar is more highly esteemed than the artist.
As a professor I found I cut more ice than as a
mere writer of fiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The position was the same in Europe, three
hundred years ago. To their contemporaries,
Salmasius seemed a far greater man than Milton.
At the time when they came into controversy
Milton was a mere minor poet, the author of a
few vernacular pieces, such as <span class='it'>Lycidas</span> and <span class='it'>Comus</span>,
and—more important in the eyes of the discerning
seventeenth century public—of a number of elegant
Latin verses. Salmasius, on the other hand,
was the most learned man of his age. His commentary
on Orosius was a vast mountain of mixed
rubbish raked out of the recesses of innumerable
libraries. He had read ten times as many books
as any other man of his age; he was therefore ten
times as great. Whether he had profited by his
reading nobody inquired. Indeed, in an age respectful
of authority, it matters not whether a man
profits by his reading or remains throughout his
life a learned ass. What is important in such an
age is the learning as such. In an age of authority
originality is not valued so highly as the capacity
to repeat, parrot-like, the sayings of the illustrious
dead—even of the unillustrious; the important
thing is that they should be dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>India is a country where tradition is strong and
authority, at any rate among the men of the older
generation, is still profoundly respected. Similar
causes produce similar effects, and one can find in
India to-day the kind of scholarship that flourished
in Europe up to the end of the seventeenth
century, together with a complementary scholar-respecting
public opinion. I had occasion to meet
several extremely learned men, whose attitude towards
the ancient Sanskrit literature, which was
the object of their studies, was the attitude of a
scholastic towards classical and mediæval Latin.
For scholars of this type every statement made by
the ancients is true and must be accepted without
criticism. Galileo’s unequal weights may fall
from the Leaning Tower in equal times. Nevertheless
bodies must fall with a speed proportional
to their weight, because Aristotle says so; and Aristotle
must not be criticised or called in question.
That was the attitude towards authority in seventeenth
century Europe. And that is still the attitude
in India. You still meet in India men of
culture who accept unquestioningly anything that
is written in an ancient book. Thus, in the ancient
mythological poems of India there are certain
descriptions of flying boats and chariots. Similar
references to flying are to be found in almost every
mythology or body of fairy tales; but it does not
occur to us to take them seriously as accounts of
actual fact. We do not claim, for example, that
Icarus anticipated Wilbur Wright. But in India,
on the other hand, these descriptions are accepted
at their face value, and I have met several intelligent
and cultured men (one of them was even a
scholar of some eminence) who have solemnly
assured me that Zeppelins were in common use
among the ancient Hindus, and that the Lord
Krishna was in the habit of flying by airship to
America and back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is obvious that, in a society where such worshippers
of ancient authority still exist, it is much
more respectable to be a learned than an original
man, a scholar than an artist. I accepted my temporary
professorship and figuratively enthroned
on the Chair of some unspecified science—for fortunately
I was never pressed too closely about my
subject—I carried my borrowed title with dignity
and even with splendour across the kingdoms of
Rajputana.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CAWNPORE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Personally I have little use for political
speaking. If I know something about the
question at issue, I find it quite unnecessary to
listen to an orator who repeats in a summarised,
and generally garbled, form the information I already
possess; knowing what I do, I am quite
capable of making up my own mind on the subject
under discussion without listening to his rhetorical
persuasions. If, on the other hand, I know nothing,
it is not to the public speaker that I turn for
the information on which to base my judgment.
The acquisition of full and accurate knowledge
about any given subject is a lengthy and generally
boring process, entailing the reading of many
books, the collating of numerous opinions. It
therefore follows, inevitably, that the imparting of
knowledge can never be part of a public speaker’s
work, for the simple reason that if his speeches are
boring and lengthy—and boring and lengthy they
must be, if he is to give anything like a fair and
full account of the facts—nobody will listen to
him. Now it happens that I have a prejudice in
favour of information. I like to know what I am
doing and why. Hence, when I am ignorant, I
go to the library, not to the public meeting. In
the library, I know, I shall be able to collect
enough facts to permit me to form an opinion of
my own. At the public meeting, on the other
hand, the speaker will give me only a garbled selection
of the available facts, and will devote the
bulk of his time and energies to persuading me by
means of rhetoric to adopt his opinions. Political
speaking is thus of no use to me. Either I know
enough about the point at issue to make the oratory
of politicians entirely superfluous; or else I know
so little that their oratory is apt to be misleading
and dangerous. In the first case I am in a position
to make up my own mind; in the second I am not,
and I do not desire to have my mind made up for
me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The All-India Congress at Cawnpore lasted for
three days, and in the course of those three days I
listened to more political speeches than I had
previously listened to in all the years of my life.
Many of them were in Hindi and therefore, to me,
incomprehensible. Of the speeches in English
most were eloquent; but for the reasons I have set
out above they were of little use to me. If the
Congress was impressive—and it did impress me,
profoundly—it was not by reason of the oratory of
the delegates. Oratory in large quantities is always
slightly ridiculous. Particularly if it is the
oratory of people who are not in a position to give
effect to their words. The English in India are
very quick in seeing this absurdity. Possessing as
they do the power to act, they have no need to talk.
It is easy for them to mock the powerless and disinherited
Indians for the luxuriant copiousness of
their eloquence. The Indians themselves are quite
aware of the absurdity of so much oratory. “We
talk too much,” an old Indian said to me. “But at
least that’s doing something. In my young days
we didn’t even talk.” In the beginning was the
word .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Words are creative. In the long run
they have a way of generating actions. But it was
not, I repeat, by the oratory that I was impressed.
It was by the orators and by their audience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Imagine an enormous tent, a hundred yards or
more in length by sixty in width. Looking up,
you could see, through the thin brown canvas of
its roof, the shadows of wind-blown flags, and from
time to time the passing silhouette of a kite or
slowly soaring vulture. The floor of the tent and
the platform were decently covered with matting,
and it was on this matting—for there were no
chairs—that the delegates sat, and sat unflinchingly,
I may add, from before noon till long after
sunset, six hours, seven hours and, on the last day,
nearly nine. Those nine foodless hours of squatting
on the floor were very nearly my last. By the
time they were over, I was all but dead of sheer
fatigue. But the delegates seemed positively to
enjoy every moment of them. Comfort and regular
meals are Western habits, which few, even of
the wealthy, have adopted in the East. The sudden
change to discomfort and protracted starvation
is very painful to Western limbs and loins,
western hams, and Western stomachs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a huge crowd. There must have been
seven or eight thousand delegates packed together
on the floor of the tent. In the old days, I was
told, it would have been a variegated crowd of
many-coloured turbans and fezes, interspersed
with European hats and sun helmets. But now,
since the days of non-co-operation, nobody wears
anything but the white cotton “Gandhi cap.” It is
an ugly headgear, like a convict’s cap. The
wearers of it find the similitude symbolic. All
India, they say, is one great gaol; for its inhabitants
the convict’s is the only suitable, the only
logical uniform. From our exalted seats on the
platform we looked down over what seemed a
great concourse of prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the size of the crowd that first impressed
me. Mere quantity is always impressive. The
human observer is small and single. Great numbers,
huge dimensions overawe him into feeling
yet more solitary and minute. In the world of art
even ugliness and disproportion can impress us, if
there be but enough of them. The buildings
which flank Victoria Street in London are architecturally
monstrous; but they are so high, and
the monotonous stretch of them is so long, that
they end by taking on a certain grandeur. The
individuals composing a Derby or Cup Final
crowd may be repulsive both in appearance and
character; but the crowd is none the less a magnificent
and impressive thing. But at Cawnpore
it was not only the quantity of humanity assembled
within the Congress tent that impressed; it was its
quality too. Looking through the crowd one was
struck by the number of fine, intelligent faces.
These faces were particularly plentiful on and in
the neighbourhood of the platform, where the
leaders and the more important of their followers
were assembled. Whenever I remarked a particularly
sensitive, intelligent or powerful face, I
would make inquiries regarding its owner. In
almost every case I found he had spent at least six
months in gaol for a political offence. After a
little practice, I learned to recognise the “criminal
type” at sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pusillus, persona contemptibilis, vivacis
ingenii et oculum habens perspicacem gratumque,
et sponte fluens ei non deerat eloquium.”
Such is William of Tyre’s description of Peter the
Hermit. It would serve equally well as a description
of Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The saint of popular imagination is a person of
majestic carriage, with a large intellectual forehead,
expressive and luminous eyes, and a good
deal of waved hair, preferably of a snowy whiteness.
I do not profess to be very well up in hagiology;
but my impression is that the majority of
the saints about whom we know any personal details
have not conformed to this ideal type. They
have been more like Peter the Hermit and Mahatma
Gandhi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The qualities which make a man a saint—faith,
an indomitable will, a passion for self-sacrifice—are
not those that extrinsicate themselves in striking
bodily stigmata. Men of great intellectual
capacities generally look what they are. Sometimes
it happens that these persons are further
possessed of saintly qualities, and then we have
the picturesque saint of popular imagination. But
one can be a saint without possessing those qualities
of mind which mould the face of genius into
such striking and unforgettable forms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking through the crowd in the Congress tent
the casual observer would have been struck by the
appearance of Mrs. Sarojini Naidu, the President
of the Congress, of Pandit Motilal Nehru, the
leader of the Swarajist Party. These people, he
would have said, are somehow intrinsically important;
their faces proclaim it. It is probable
that he would never even have noticed the little
man in the dhoti, with the shawl over his naked
shoulders; the emaciated little man with the
shaved head, the large ears, the rather foxy features;
the quiet little man, whose appearance is
only remarkable when he laughs—for he laughs
with the whole-hearted laughter of a child, and his
smile has an unexpected and boyish charm. No,
the casual observer would probably never even
have noticed Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CAWNPORE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In the West we admire a man who fasts in order
to break a world’s record or win a wager; we
understand his motives and can sympathise with
them. But the man who goes out for forty days
into the wilderness (and forty days, it may be
added, are nothing in comparison with modern
records), the man who fasts for the good of his
soul has become incomprehensible to us. We regard
him with suspicion and not, as our ancestors
would have done, with reverence. So far from
worshipping him, we think that he ought to be
put into an asylum. With us, the ascetic, the mortifier
of the flesh for the sake of the “spirit,” the
self-tormentor, has ceased to command respect.
We still admire the saint who gives up wealth and
worldly advantage for the sake of an idea. But
we demand that his sacrifice shall not be too excessive,
at any rate in appearance. We deplore such
visible symptoms of sainthood as the hair shirt.
We do not like a saint to sacrifice, along with his
money and his worldly success, his clothes, his
comfort, his family ties, his marriage-bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In India things are different. Amongst the
Hindus the enthusiasm for sainthood, even in its
extremest manifestations, is as strong as it was
among the Christians of the first centuries. Eloquence
and energy and what is called personal
magnetism are enough amongst us to make a man
a successful leader of the people. But to capture
the imagination of the Indian masses a man must
possess, besides these qualities, the characteristics
of a saint. A Disraeli can captivate the hearts of
the English; he could have no sort of popular
success in India. In India the most influential
popular leader of modern times is Gandhi, who
is a saint and an ascetic, not a politician at all.
Sanctity and political astuteness are rarely combined.
Gandhi’s saintliness gave him power over
the people; but he lacked the political ability to
use that power to the best advantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward Lear has a rhyme about</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;an old man of Thermopylae,</p>
<p class='line'>Who never did anything properly.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>To the Westerner all Indians seem old men of
Thermopylae. In the ordinary affairs of life, I
am a bit of a Thermopylean myself. But even I
am puzzled, disquieted, and rather exasperated by
the Indians. To a thoroughly neat-minded and
efficient man, with a taste for tidiness and strong
views about respectability, and the keeping up of
appearances, Indians must be literally maddening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would be possible to compile a long and
varied list of what I may call Indian Thermopylisms.
But I prefer to confine my attention to the
Thermopylean behaviour of Indians in a single
sphere of activity—that of ceremonial. For it is,
I think, in matters of ceremonial and the keeping
up of appearances that Indians most conspicuously
fail, in our Western opinion, “to do anything properly.”
Nobody who has looked into a temple, or
witnessed the ceremonies of an Indian marriage
can fail to have been struck by the extraordinary
“sloppiness” and inefficiency of the symbolical performances.
The sublime is constantly alternated
with the ridiculous and trivial, and the most monstrous
incongruities are freely mingled. The old
man of Thermopylae is as busy in the palace as in
the temple; and the abodes of Indian potentates
are an incredible mixture of the magnificent and
the cheap, the grandiose and the ludicrously
homely. Cows bask on the front steps; the anteroom
is filthy with the droppings of pigeons;
beggars doze under the gates, or search one another’s
heads for lice; in one of the inner courts
fifty courtesans from the city are singing interminable
songs in honour of the birth of the Maharaja’s
eleventh grandchild; in the throne room, nobody
quite knows why, there stands a brass bedstead
with a sham mahogany wardrobe from the
Tottenham Court Road beside it; framed colour
prints from the Christmas number of the <span class='it'>Graphic</span>
of 1907 alternate along the walls with the most exquisite
Rajput and Persian miniatures; in the unswept
jewel room, five million pounds worth of
precious stones lies indiscriminately heaped; the
paintings are peeling off the walls of the private
apartments, a leprosy has attacked the stucco, there
is a hole in the carpet; the marble hall of audience
is furnished with bamboo chairs, and the Rolls-Royces
are driven by ragged chauffeurs who blow
their noses on the long and wind-blown end of
their turbans. As an Englishman belonging to
that impecunious but dignified section of the upper
middle class which is in the habit of putting on
dress clothes to eat—with the most studied decorum
and out of porcelain and burnished silver—a
dinner of dishwater and codfish, mock duck and
cabbage, I was always amazed, I was pained and
shocked by this failure on the part of Eastern
monarchs to keep up appearances, and do what is
owing to their position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was even more helplessly bewildered by the
Thermopylean behaviour of the delegates at the
Cawnpore Congress during Mr. Gandhi’s speech
on the position of Indians in South Africa. The
applause when he ascended the rostrum was loud—though
rather less loud than a Western observer
might have expected. Indian audiences are not
much given to yelling or hand-clapping and it is
not possible when one is sitting on the floor, to
stamp one’s feet. But though the noise was small,
the enthusiasm was evidently very great. And
yet, when the Mahatma began to speak, there was
more talking and fidgetting, more general inattention
than during any other speech of the day.
True, it was late in the afternoon when Mr.
Gandhi made his speech. The delegates had spent
a long and hungry day sitting on a floor that certainly
grew no softer with the passage of the hours.
There was every reason for their feeling the need
to relax their minds and stretch their cramped legs.
But however acute its weariness had become, a
Western audience would surely have postponed
the moment of relaxation until the great man had
finished speaking. Even if it had found the speech
boring, it would have felt itself bound to listen
silently and with attention to a great and admired
national hero. It would have considered that chattering
and fidgetting were signs of disrespect. Not
so, evidently, the Indian audience. To show disrespect
for the Mahatma was probably the last
thing in the world that the Cawnpore delegates
desired. Nevertheless they talked all through the
speech, they stretched their stiff legs, they called
for water, they went out for little strolls in the
Congress grounds and came back, noisily. Knowing
how Englishmen could comport themselves
during a speech by a national hero, combining in
his single person the sanctity of the Archbishop
of Canterbury with the popularity of the Prince
of Wales, I was astonished, I was profoundly
puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an earlier entry in this diary I attributed the
Thermopylism of the Indians to a certain emotional
agility (shared, to some extent, by the natives
of Southern Europe), to a capacity for feeling two
things at once or, at least, in very rapid succession.
Indians and Neapolitans, I pointed out, can reverence
their gods even while spitting, jesting, and
picking their noses. But this explanation does not
go far enough; it requires itself to be explained.
How is it that, while we are brought up to practise
consistency of behaviour, the children of other
races are educated so as to be emotionally agile?
Why are we so carefully taught to keep up the
appearances which to others seem so negligible?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reflecting on my observations in Italy and in
India, I am led to believe that these questions must
be answered in one way for the Southern Europeans,
in another for the Indians. The emotional
agility of the Italians is due to the profound
“realism” of their outlook, coupled with their ingrained
habit of judging things in terms of
æsthetics. Thus, the Southern European may admire
a religious service or a royal procession as
works of art, while holding strong atheistical and
anti-monarchical opinions; he will be able to mock
and to admire simultaneously. And perhaps he
is not an atheist or a republican at all. But however
ardently a Christian or a monarchist, he will
always find himself able to reflect—while he
kneels before the elevated Host or cheers the royal
barouche—that the priest and the king make a
very good thing out of their business, and that
they are, after all, only human, like himself—probably
all too human. As for the shabbinesses and
absurdities of the performance, he will ignore
them in his appreciation of the grandiose intention,
the artistic general effect. And he will regard the
Northerner who wants the performance to be perfect
in every detail as a laborious and unimaginative
fool. Nor will he understand the Northerner’s
passion for keeping up appearances in ordinary
daily life. The Southerner has a liking for display;
but his display is different from ours. When
we go in for keeping up appearances, we do the
job, not showily, but thoroughly, and at every
point. We want all the rooms in our house to look
“nice,” we want everything in it to be “good”; we
train our servants to behave as nearly as possible
like automatons, and we put on special clothes to
eat even the worst of dinners. The Southerner, on
the other hand, concentrates his display into a
single splendid flourish. He likes to get something
spectacular for his money and his aim is to
achieve, not respectability, but a work of art. He
gives his house a splendid façade, trusting that
every lover of the grandiose will be content to
contemplate the marble front, without peering too
closely at the brick and rubble behind. He will
furnish one drawing-room in style, for state occasions.
To keep up appearances at every point—for
oneself and one’s servants, as well as for the
outside world—seems to him a folly and a waste
of spirit. Life is meant to be enjoyed, and occasional
grandiosities are part of the fun. But on
ordinary days of the week it is best enjoyed in shirt
sleeves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indian’s Thermopylisms are due, it seems
to me, to entirely different causes. He is careless
about keeping up appearances, because appearances
seem to him as nothing in comparison with
“spiritual reality.” He is slack in the performance
of anything in the nature of symbolic ceremonial,
because the invisible thing symbolised
seems to him so much more important than the
symbol. He is a Thermopylean, not through excess
of “realism” and the æsthetic sense, but
through excess of “spirituality.” Thus the Maharaja
does not trouble to make his surroundings
look princely, because he feels that princeliness
lies within him, not without. Marriages are made
in heaven; therefore it is unnecessary to take
trouble about mere marriage ceremonies on earth.
And if the soul of every Indian is overflowing with
love and respect for Mahatma Gandhi, why should
Congress delegates trouble to give that respect
the merely physical form of silence and motionlessness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such arguments, of course, are never consciously
put. But the training of Indians is such that they
act as though in obedience to them. They have
been taught that this present world is more or less
illusory, that the aim of every man should be to
break out of the cycle of recurrent birth, that the
“soul” is everything and that the highest values
are purely “spiritual.” Owing to their early inculcation,
such beliefs have tended to become almost
instinctive, even in the minds of those whose
consciously formulated philosophy of life is of an
entirely different character. It is obvious that
people holding such beliefs will attach the smallest
importance to the keeping up of appearances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these matters we Northerners behave like
Behaviourists—as though the visible or audible
expression of an idea were the idea itself, as
though the symbol in some sort created the notion
symbolised. Our religious rites, our acts of
“natural piety” are solemnly performed, and with
an almost military precision. The impressive service,
we have found, actually manufactures God;
the memorial ceremony creates and conserves our
interest in the dead. Our royal pageantry is no
less rich, no less consistently effective; for the
pageant <span class='it'>is</span> the king. Our judges are wigged and
magnificently robed. Absurd survival! But no;
the majesty of the law consists in the wigs and the
ermine. Then gentry keeps up appearances to the
limit of its financial means and beyond. It is a
folly, protests the believer in “spiritual” realities.
On the contrary, it is profound wisdom, based on
the instinctive recognition of a great historical
truth. History shows us that there were rites before
there were dogmas, that there were conventions
of behaviour before there was morality.
Dogmas, indeed, have often been the children of
rites—systems of thought called into existence to
explain gestures. Morality is the theory of pre-existing
social habits. (In the same way some of
the greatest advances in mathematics have been
due to the invention of symbols, which it afterwards
became necessary to explain; from the
minus sign proceeded the whole theory of negative
quantities.) To sceptics desirous of believing,
catholic directors of conscience prescribe the outward
and visible practice of religion; practice,
they know, brings forth faith; the formal appearance
of religion creates its “spiritual” essence. It
is the same with civilisation; men who practise
the conventional ritual of civilisation become civilised.
Appearing to be civilised, they really are
so. For civilisation is nothing but a series of conventions;
being civilised is obeying those conventions,
is keeping up the appearances of culture,
prosperity, and good manners. The more widely
and the more efficiently such appearances are kept
up, the better the civilisation. There can never be
a civilisation that ignores appearances and is wholly
“spiritual.” A civilisation based on Quaker principles
could not come into existence; Quakerism
in all its forms is the product, by reaction, of a
civilisation already highly developed. Before one
can ignore appearances and conventions, there
must be, it is obvious, conventions and appearances
to ignore. The Simple Life is simple only in comparison
with some existing life of complicated
convention. If Quaker principles ceased to be the
luxury of a refined few, and were accepted by the
world at large, civilisation would soon cease to
exist: freed from the necessity of keeping up the
appearance of being civilised, the majority of human
beings would rapidly become barbarous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Admirers of India are unanimous in praising
Hindu “spirituality.” I cannot agree with them.
To my mind “spirituality” (ultimately, I suppose,
the product of the climate) is the primal curse of
India and the cause of all her misfortunes. It is
this preoccupation with “spiritual” realities, different
from the actual historical realities of common
life, that has kept millions upon millions of
men and women content, through centuries, with
a lot unworthy of human beings. A little less
spirituality, and the Indians would now be free—free
from foreign dominion and from the tyranny
of their own prejudices and traditions. There
would be less dirt and more food. There would
be fewer Maharajas with Rolls-Royces and more
schools. The women would be out of their prisons,
and there would be some kind of polite and conventional
social life—one of those despised appearances
of civilisation which are yet the very
stuff and essence of civilised existence. At a safe
distance and from the midst of a network of sanitary
plumbing, Western observers, disgusted, not
unjustifiably, with their own civilisation, express
their admiration for the “spirituality” of the Indians,
and for the immemorial contentment which
is the fruit of it. Sometimes, such is their enthusiasm,
this admiration actually survives a visit to
India.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is for its “materialism” that our Western civilisation
is generally blamed. Wrongly, I think.
For materialism—if materialism means a preoccupation
with the actual world in which we live—is
something wholly admirable. If Western
civilisation is unsatisfactory, that is not because we
are interested in the actual world; it is because the
majority of us are interested in such an absurdly
small part of it. Our world is wide, incredibly
varied and more fantastic than any product of the
imagination. And yet the lives of the vast majority
of men and women among the Western peoples are
narrow, monotonous, and dull. We are not materialistic
enough; that is the trouble. We do not
interest ourselves in a sufficiency of this marvellous
world of ours. Travel is cheap and rapid;
the immense accumulations of modern knowledge
lie heaped up on every side. Every man with a
little leisure and enough money for railway tickets,
every man, indeed, who knows how to read, has it
in his power to magnify himself, to multiply the
ways in which he exists, to make his life full, significant,
and interesting. And yet, for some inexplicable
reason, most of us prefer to spend our
leisure and our surplus energies in elaborately,
brainlessly, and expensively murdering time. Our
lives are consequently barren and uninteresting
and we are, in general, only too acutely conscious
of the fact. The remedy is more materialism and
not, as false prophets from the East assert, more
“spirituality”—more interest in this world, not in
the other. The Other World—the world of metaphysics
and religion—can never possibly be as
interesting as this world, and for an obvious reason.
The Other World is an invention of the human
fancy and shares the limitations of its creator.
This world, on the other hand, the world of the
materialists, is the fantastic and incredible invention
of—well, not in any case of Mrs. Annie
Besant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the speeches were in Hindi, some in
English. When a man began in English, there
would be a shout of “Hindi! Hindi!” from the
patriots of Upper India. Those, on the other
hand, who began in Hindi would find themselves
interrupted by protests from the Tamil speaking
delegates of the south, who called for English.
Pandit Motilal Nehru, the leader of the Swaraj
party, delivered his principal oration in Hindi.
When it was over, an excited man jumped up and
complained to the President and the Congress at
large that he had spent upwards of a hundred
rupees coming from somewhere beyond Madras to
listen to his leader—a hundred rupees, and the
leader had spoken in Hindi; he had not understood
a single word. Later in the day, one of his
compatriots mounted the rostrum and retaliated
on the north by making a very long and totally incomprehensible
speech in Tamil. The north was
furious, naturally. These are some of the minor

<p class='pindent'>The capitalist, the tax-collector, and the policeman

of slaving for, paying taxes to and being put into
prison by people of one’s own, rather than by
people of another race may seem unimportant and
hardly worth the trouble involved in ejecting alien

about the matter; but in politics, as in science, one
untested theory is as good, or as bad, as another.
It is only experimentally that we can discover
which out of a number of alternatives is the best
hypothesis. Now the bewildering charm of politics
lies in the fact that you cannot experimentally
test the truth of alternative theories. At any given
moment, only one choice can be made. For example,
there were in 1916 certain people who held
that it would be a good thing to make peace at
once. There were others who thought that it
would not. One cannot, it is obvious, simultaneously
make peace and war. Our rulers decided
in favour of war. The theory of those who
thought that it would be a good thing for the world
to make peace in 1916 was never tested. We know
by experiment that it was an extremely bad thing
to go on making war to the bitter end. To have
made a premature peace might have been still
worse; on the other hand it might have been better.
It remains a matter of opinion. Nobody can ever
know. There is no science of politics, because
there is no such thing as a political laboratory
where experiments can be made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truth of the theories about the capacity or
incapacity of the Indians to govern themselves can
only be tested experimentally. They are at present
merely the divergent opinions of the interested
parties. I happen not to be an interested party;
(for I do not consider that the mere fact of being,
on the one hand, an Englishman and, on the other,
a liberal with prejudices in favour of freedom and
self-determination, makes me directly responsible
for either the integrity of the British Empire or
the liberation of the Indian people); it is easy for
me to suspend judgment until the production of
proof. But if I were a member of the I.C.S., or
if I held shares in a Calcutta jute mill (I wish I
did), I should believe in all sincerity that British
rule had been an unmixed blessing to India and
that the Indians were quite incapable of governing
themselves. And if I were an educated Indian,
I should most certainly have gone to gaol for acting
on my belief in the contraries of these propositions.
Moreover, even if, as an Indian, I shared
the Englishman’s belief, even if it could somehow
be proved that Swaraj would bring, as its immediate
consequences, communal discord, religious and
political wars, the oppression of the lower by the
higher castes, inefficiency and corruption, in a
word, general anarchy—even if this could be
proved, I think I should still go on trying to obtain
Swaraj. There are certain things about which
it is not possible, it is not right to take the reasonable,
the utilitarian view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this political talk, all this political action
even—I begin to wonder, after eight and a
half hours on the floor of the Congress tent,
whether it isn’t entirely a waste of time. Political
power is the invariable concomitant of economic
power. Be rich, control your country’s finance
and industry, and you will find that you have political
leadership thrown in as a casual perquisite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indian industries were deliberately discouraged
by the East India Company, which found itself
able to make more money by selling English manufactured
goods to the Indians than by selling Indian
manufactured goods to the English. When,
after a considerable lapse of time, modern industrialism
began to be introduced into India, it was
introduced under foreign auspices and it is still,
along with the Indian banking system, mainly foreign-owned.
The foreigners rule; it is inevitable.
But the All-India Congress goes on talking and
acting in terms of politics. One might as well try
to cure headaches by applying corn plasters to the
toes.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CAWNPORE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>My prejudices happen to be in favor of democracy,
self-determination, and all the rest of
it. But political convictions are generally the fruit
of chance rather than of deliberate choice. If I
had been brought up a little differently, I might,
I suppose, have been a Fascist and an apostle of
the most full-blooded imperialism. But when I
am honest with myself, I have to admit that I don’t
care two pins about political principles. Provided
that it guaranteed my safety and left me in peace
to do my work, I should live just as happily under
an alien despotism as under the British constitution.
If, in the past, men have fought for democracy
and made revolutions for the attainment of
self-government, it has generally been because they
hoped that these things would lead to better administration
than could be had under despotism
and foreign dominion. Once better government
has been obtained, democracy and self-determination—as
such and in themselves—cease to interest
those who, a short time before, had passionately
fought for them.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CAWNPORE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Serfs, burghers, nobles—we read about them
in our history books; but we find it difficult to
realise what mediæval society was really like. To
understand our European Middle Ages, one
should go to India. Hereditary aristocracies still
exist in the West—exist, but <span class='it'>pour rire</span>; they are
scarcely more than a joke. It is in India that one
learns what it meant, six hundred years ago, to be
a villein, a merchant, a lord. Aristocracy, there,
exists in fact, as well as in name. Birth counts.
You come into the world predestined to superiority
or abjection; it is a kind of social Calvinism.
Some are born with Grace; they are Brahmans or
Kshatryas. The rest are damned from the beginning.
Outcasts, peasants, money-lenders, merchants—the
Indian hell has lower and higher
circles; but even the upper circles are only the
attics of the social abyss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost without exception Indian politicians
profess democratic principles. They envisage a
popularly governed British dominion, ultimately a
republic. Government by the people, for the
people, and so on. But the majority of the influential
ones are members of the highest castes,
hereditary wise men and warriors. Their principles
may be democratic, but their instincts remain
profoundly aristocratic. Transplant a few mediæval
cardinals and dukes across the centuries into
modern Europe; you might convince them that
democracy was a good thing, but you could hardly
expect them to forget from one day to the next
their prejudices about villeins and burgesses, their
conviction of their own inherent nobility. I have
seen high-caste educated Indians treating their inferiors
in a way which to a bourgeois like myself,
born in even so moderately democratic a society as
that of England, seemed unthinkably high-handed.
I envied them the sense of assured and inalienable
superiority which enabled them so naturally to
play the part of the mediæval noble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the lower-caste masses would suffer, at the
beginning, in any case, from a return to Indian
autonomy seems almost indubitable. Where the
superiority of the upper classes to the lower is a
matter of religious dogma, you can hardly expect
the governing few to be particularly careful about
the rights of the many. It is even something of
a heresy to suppose that they have rights. Any
indigenous government under Swaraj would necessarily
be in the nature of a despotic oligarchy—that
is, until education has spread so widely that
another and more democratic form of government
becomes practicable. One can only hope, piously,
that the despotism will be paternal and that the
education will spread quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the evil results of the political subjection
of one people by another is that it tends
to make the subject nation unnecessarily and excessively
conscious of its past. Its achievements in
the old great days of freedom are remembered,
counted over and exaggerated by a generation of
slaves, anxious to convince the world and themselves
that they are as good as their masters. Slaves
cannot talk of their present greatness, because it
does not exist; and prophetic visions of the future
are necessarily vague and unsatisfying. There remains
the past. Out of the scattered and isolated
facts of history it is possible to build up Utopias
and Cloud Cuckoo Lands as variously fantastic as
the New Jerusalems of prophecy. It is to the
past—the gorgeous imaginary past of those whose
present is inglorious, sordid, and humiliating—it
is to the delightful founded-on-fact romances of
history that subject peoples invariably turn. Thus,
the savage and hairy chieftains of Ireland became
in due course “the Great Kings of Leinster,” “the
mighty Emperors of Meath.” Through centuries
of slavery the Serbs remembered and idealised the
heroes of Kossovo. And for the oppressed Poles,
the mediæval Polish empire was much more
powerful, splendid, and polite than the Roman.
The English have never been an oppressed nationality;
they are in consequence most healthily
unaware of their history. They live wholly in the
much more interesting worlds of the present—in
the worlds of politics and science, of business and
industry. So fully, indeed, do they live in the
present, that they have compelled the Indians, like
the Irish at the other end of the world, to turn to
the past. In the course of the last thirty or forty
years a huge pseudo-historical literature has
sprung up in India, the melancholy product of
a subject people’s inferiority complex. Industrious
and intelligent men have wasted their time and
their abilities in trying to prove that the ancient
Hindus were superior to every other people in
every activity of life. Thus, each time the West
has announced a new scientific discovery, misguided
scholars have ransacked Sanskrit literature
to find a phrase that might be interpreted as a
Hindu anticipation of it. A sentence of a dozen
words, obscure even to the most accomplished
Sanskrit scholars, is triumphantly quoted to prove
that the ancient Hindus were familiar with the
chemical constitution of water. Another, no less
brief, is held up as the proof that they anticipated
Pasteur in the discovery of the microbic origin of
disease. A passage from the mythological poem
of the Mahabharata proves that they had invented
the Zeppelin. Remarkable people, these old Hindus.
They knew everything that we know or,
indeed, are likely to discover, at any rate until
India is a free country; but they were unfortunately
too modest to state the fact baldly and in so
many words. A little more clarity on their part,
a little less reticence, and India would now be
centuries ahead of her Western rivals. But they
preferred to be oracular and telegraphically brief.
It is only after the upstart West has repeated their
discoveries that the modern Indian commentator
upon their works can interpret their dark sayings
as anticipations. On contemporary Indian scholars
the pastime of discovering and creating these anticipations
never seems to pall. Such are the
melancholy and futile occupations of intelligent
men who have the misfortune to belong to a subject
race. Free men would never dream of wasting
their time and wit upon such vanities. From
those who have not shall be taken away even that
which they have.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A noble banyan tree stands by the side of the
Jaunpur road, where it leaves the Civil Lines.
Under the dense foliage lingers a kind of ecclesiastical
darkness and the rooted and already massive
offshoots from the parent branches are the cathedral
pillars. But the shoots which have not yet
reached the ground, but hang in the dim air like
the ends of aimlessly trailing cables, have an aspect
strangely sinister and unholy. They hang there,
motionless; and the cathedral of the banyan grove
is transformed into a Piranesian prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The banyan is like the Hindu family. Its scions
remain, even in maturity, attached to the parent
tree. The national tree of England is the oak,
and English families—once, no doubt, as banyan-like
as the Indian—are coming to resemble handfuls
of scattered acorns that grow up at a distance
from their tree of origin. Those who have had,
in India or on the continent of Europe, any experience
of the really united banyan family, can
only feel thankful at the turn our social botany
is taking.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BENARES, January 14, 1926</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was said that the eclipse of the sun would be
visible from Benares. But it needed more than
smoked glass to see it; the eye of faith was also
indispensable. That, alas, we did not possess.
Partial to the point of being non-existent, the
eclipse remained, for us at least, unseen. Not that
we minded. For it was not to look at the moon’s
silhouette that we had rowed out that morning on
the Ganges; it was to look at the Hindus looking
at it. The spectacle was vastly more extraordinary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was, at the lowest estimate, a million of
them on the bathing ghats that morning. A million.
All the previous night and day they had been
streaming into the town. We had met them on
every road, trudging with bare feet through the
dust, an endless and silent procession. In bundles
balanced on their heads they carried provisions and
cooking utensils and dried dung for fuel, with the
new clothes which it is incumbent on pious Hindus
to put on, after their bath in honour of the eclipsed
sun. Many had come far. The old men leaned
wearily on their bamboo staves. Their children
astride of their hips, the burdens on their heads
automatically balanced, the women walked in a
trance of fatigue. Here and there we would see
a little troop that had sat down to rest—casually,
as is the way of Indians, in the dust of the road and
almost under the wheels of the passing vehicles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now the day and the hour had come. The
serpent was about to swallow the sun. (It was
about to swallow him in Sumatra, at any rate. At
Benares it would do no more than nibble imperceptibly
at the edge of his disk. The serpent,
should one say, was going to try to swallow the
sun.) A million of men and women had come together
at Benares to assist the Light of Heaven
against his enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ghats go down in furlong-wide flights of
steps to the river, which lies like a long arena at
the foot of enormous tiers of seats. The tiers were
thronged to-day. Floating on the Ganges, we
looked up at acres upon sloping acres of humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the smaller and comparatively unsacred ghats
the crowd was a little less densely packed than on
the holiest steps. It was at one of these less crowded
ghats that we witnessed the embarkation on the
sacred river of a princess. Canopied and curtained
with glittering cloth of gold, a palanquin came
staggering down through the crowd on the shoulders
of six red-liveried attendants. A great barge,
like a Noah’s ark, its windows hung with scarlet
curtains, floated at the water’s edge. The major-domo
shouted and shoved and hit out with his
rod of office; a way was somehow cleared. Slowly
and with frightful lurchings, the palanquin descended.
It was set down, and in the twinkling
of an eye a little passage way of canvas had been
erected between the litter and the door of the barge.
There was a heaving of the cloth of gold, a flapping
of the canvas; the lady—the ladies, for there
were several of them in the litter—had entered
the barge unobserved by any vulgar eye. Which
did not prevent them, a few minutes later when
the barge had been pushed out into mid-stream,
from lifting the scarlet curtains and peering out
with naked faces and unabashed curiosity at the
passing boats and our inquisitive camera. Poor
princesses! They could not bathe with their plebeian
and unimprisoned sisters in the open Ganges. Their
dip was to be in the barge’s bilge water. The sacred
stream is filthy enough under the sky. What must
it be like after stagnating in darkness at the bottom
of an ancient barge?</p>

<p class='pindent'>We rowed on towards the burning ghats.
Stretched out on their neat little oblong pyres, two
or three corpses were slowly smouldering. They
lay on burning faggots, they were covered by them.
Gruesomely and grotesquely, their bare feet projected,
like the feet of those who sleep uneasily on
a bed too short and under exiguous blankets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little further on we saw a row of holy men,
sitting like cormorants on a narrow ledge of masonry
just above the water. Cross-legged, their
hands dropped limply, palm upwards, on the
ground beside them, they contemplated the brown
and sweating tips of their noses. It was the Lord
Krishna himself who, in the <span class='it'>Bhagavad Gita</span>, prescribed
that mystic squint. Lord Krishna, it is
evident, knew all that there is to be known about
the art of self-hypnotism. His simple method has
never been improved on; it puts the mystical
ecstasy <span class='it'>à la portée de tous</span>. The noise of an assembled
million filled the air; but no sound could
break the meditative sleep of the nose-gazers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a given moment the eye of faith must have
observed the nibblings of the demoniacal serpent.
For suddenly and simultaneously all those on the
lowest steps of the ghats threw themselves into the
water and began to wash and gargle, to say their
prayers and blow their noses, to spit and drink. A
numerous band of police abbreviated their devotions
and their bath in the interest of the crowds
behind. The front of the waiting queue was a
thousand yards wide; but a million people were
waiting. The bathing must have gone on uninterruptedly
the whole day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time passed. The serpent went on nibbling imperceptibly
at the sun. The Hindus counted their
beads and prayed, made ritual gestures, ducked
under the sacred slime, drank, and were moved
on by the police to make room for another instalment
of the patient million. We rowed up and
down, taking snapshots. West is West.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of the serpent, the sun was uncommonly
hot on our backs. After a couple of hours on the
river, we decided that we had had enough, and
landed. The narrow lanes that lead from the
ghats to the open streets in the centre of the town
were lined with beggars, more or less holy. They
sat on the ground with their begging bowls before
them; the charitable, as they passed, would throw
a few grains of rice into each of the bowls. By
the end of the day the beggars might, with luck,
have accumulated a square meal. We pushed our
way slowly through the thronged alleys. From
an archway in front of us emerged a sacred bull.
The nearest beggar was dozing at his post—those
who eat little sleep much. The bull lowered its
muzzle to the sleeping man’s bowl, made a scouring
movement with its black tongue, and a morning’s
charity had gone. The beggar still dozed.
Thoughtfully chewing, the Hindu totem turned
back the way it had come and disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being stupid and having no imagination, animals
often behave far more sensibly than men. Efficiently
and by instinct they do the right, appropriate
thing at the right moment—eat when they are
hungry, look for water when they feel thirst, make
love in the mating season, rest or play when they
have leisure. Men are intelligent and imaginative;
they look backwards and ahead; they invent ingenious
explanation for observed phenomena; they
devise elaborate and roundabout means for the
achievement of remote ends. Their intelligence,
which has made them the masters of the world,
often causes them to act like imbeciles. No animal,
for example, is clever and imaginative enough
to suppose that an eclipse is the work of a serpent
devouring the sun. That is the sort of explanation
that could occur only to the human mind. And
only a human being would dream of making ritual
gestures in the hope of influencing, for his own
benefit, the outside world. While the animal, obedient
to its instinct, goes quietly about its business,
man, being endowed with reason and imagination,
wastes half his time and energy in doing things
that are completely idiotic. In time, it is true,
experience teaches him that magic formulas and
ceremonial gestures do not give him what he wants.
But until experience has taught him—and he takes
a surprisingly long time to learn—man’s behaviour
is in many respects far sillier than that of the
animal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I reflected, as I watched the sacred bull lick
up the rice from the dozing beggar’s bowl. While
a million people undertake long journeys, suffer fatigue,
hunger, and discomfort in order to perform,
in a certain stretch of very dirty water, certain
antics for the benefit of a fixed star ninety million
miles away, the bull goes about looking for food
and fills its belly with whatever it can find. In
this case, it is obvious, the bull’s brainlessness
causes it to act much more rationally than its
masters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To save the sun (which might, one feels, very
safely be left to look after itself) a million of
Hindus will assemble on the banks of the Ganges.
How many, I wonder, would assemble to save
India? An immense energy which, if it could be
turned into political channels, might liberate and
transform the country, is wasted in the name of
imbecile superstitions. Religion is a luxury which
India, in its present condition, cannot possibly afford.
India will never be free until the Hindus
and the Moslems are as tepidly enthusiastic about
their religion as we are about the Church of England.

<h2 class='nobreak'>LUCKNOW</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of the second day of the All-India
Musical Conference, I declared a strike. Accustomed
to the ordinary three-hour day of the
European concert goer, I found myself exhausted
by the seven or eight hours of daily listening imposed
on me by the makers of the Lucknow programme.
There was one long concert every morning,
another every afternoon, a third at night. It
was too much. After the second day I would not
go again. Still, before I struck, I had had sixteen
hours of Indian music—enough, at home, to hear
all the symphonies of Beethoven, with a good
sprinkling of characteristic specimens from Mozart
and Bach thrown in. Sixteen hours of listening
should be enough to give one at least the hang
of an unfamiliar music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professional musicians, mostly attached to the
courts of reigning princes, had come to Lucknow
from every part of India. There were accomplished
singers and celebrated players of every
Indian instrument—including even the harmonium
which, to my great astonishment and greater disgust,
was permitted to snore and whine in what I
was assured was the very sanctuary of Indian music.
I listened to all the virtuosity of India. That it
touched me less than the more modest accomplishment
of the old Lahore musician was due, I think,
to purely physical causes. The vina and the sitar
must be heard at close quarters. All the expression
and feeling that a performer puts into his playing
evaporates at a distance and nothing can be heard
beyond the jangle of the plucked strings. At
Lahore I had been amazed by the richness and
variety of the tone that came out of the old musician’s
sitar. At Lucknow, where the concerts were
held in a large tent, I was wearied by its tinkling
monotony. Space had sucked the soul out of the
music; it came to me dry and dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much is enthusiastically talked about the use of
quarter-tones in Indian music. I listened attentively
at Lucknow in the hope of hearing some new
and extraordinary kind of melody based on these
celebrated fractions. But I listened in vain. The
scales in which Indian music is written are of quite
familiar types. The pentatonic or black-note scale,
for example, seems to be a favourite; and any one
learned in ancient European music would probably
find no difficulty in labelling with their modal
names the various melodies of India. The quarter-tone
makes its appearance only in the slurred transition
from one note of the fundamental scale to
another. The sentimental tzigane violinist and the
jazz-band player make just as free a use of quarter-tones
as do the Indians, and in precisely the same
way.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>LUCKNOW</h2>

<p class='pindent'>There was an All-India Art Exhibition at
Lucknow as well as an All-India Musical
Conference. Some of the pictures were ancient,
some contemporary. The old were not conspicuously
interesting specimens, the modern, I regret
to say, were incredibly bad. I do not exaggerate
when I say that there was no contemporary exhibitor
at Lucknow who showed the smallest trace
of artistic ability. I can only suppose that, for
one reason or another, those Indians who have talent
do not become artists. Of the men exhibiting
at Lucknow, most, I noticed, were teachers in Government
Art Schools and therefore the last people
in the world one would expect to be artists. The
others were mostly patriotic amateurs who thought
that modern India ought to have a national art of
its own and had set out to create it. The intention
was laudable. But in art, alas, intentions
and high moral purpose count for very little. It
is the talent that matters, and talent was precisely
the thing that none of them possessed.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>LUCKNOW</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At the Lucknow hotel the coffee, instead of
being undrinkable in the familiar Britannic
way, was made of chicory. I sipped, and instantaneously
all France was present to me—the whole
of it at once and through twenty years of history.
The Reims of last year with the Chamonix of
1907, Grenoble before the War, Fontainebleau in
1925, Paris at every date from the opening of the
Edwardian era onwards. Within its own particular
Gallic sphere that drop of liquid chicory was
as miraculously efficacious as the Last Trump. The
dead sprang to life, were visible and spoke—in
French. There was a resurrection of French landscapes
and French monuments. Forgotten incidents
re-enacted themselves for me, against a trench
background: dead pleasures and miseries, dead
shames and elations experienced within the boundaries
of France, shot up, like so many Jacks-in-the-box
from under suddenly lifted tombstones. I finished
my breakfast in France and in the past, and
walked abroad. At the end of remembered and
phantasmal boulevards loomed up the relics of the
Indian Mutiny and the gimcrack palaces of the
Kings of Oudh. Dark-faced and turbanned, an
Indian policeman walked clean through the tenuous
ghosts of friends and lovers. Gradually the
resurrected died again; the tombstones closed on
graves that were once more tenanted. The present
had conquered the past; at an impact from outside
the inward world had fallen to pieces. I addressed
myself to the enjoyment of immediate pleasures.
But I looked forward to to-morrow’s breakfast;
the chicory, I felt sure, would repeat the miracle.
These resuscitators of the past, these personal Last
Trumps may be relied on, if they are not abused,
to produce a constant and invariable effect. There
is a certain tune (by Sousa, I think) which I can
never hear without remembering my convalescence
at school after an attack of mumps. I remember
myself looking out of a window, and humming the
tune, interminably, for hours, feeling as I did so
profoundly, but most enjoyably, miserable—goodness
knows why. And then, still more mysteriously
moving, there is a certain smell, occasionally
mingled with the smoke of autumn bonfires; a smell
that is due to the combustion of some exotic rubbish,
but rarely mingled with the ordinary muck,
and whose identity I have never been able to trace;
a strange, sweetish smell, like the unhealthy caricature
of a scent; a smell that every time I sniff it
reminds me urgently and agonisingly of something
in my past life, some cardinal incident, some crisis,
some turning point, which I know to be profoundly
significant, but which I am chronically unable to
recall. What is more irritating than to find a knot
in one’s handkerchief, to be reminded that the commission
was desperately important, and to find
oneself incapable of remembering what it was?
I have a feeling that if only I could remember
what that bonfire smell reminded me of, I should
be perceptibly nearer to solving the problem of
the universe. But my best efforts have always
proved unavailing. I have a fear that I shall never
remember.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>DELHI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Viceroy’s speech at the opening of the
Legislative Assembly was mainly official and
expository. But it contained a few more moving
passages of the few-well-chosen-words variety. His
voice trembling—a trifle studiedly—with suppressed
emotion, His Excellency professed himself
“grieved” that the Indian response to Lord Birkenhead’s
“generous gesture” (I think those were
the words) had been so inadequate. I have forgotten
whether he actually went on to speak about
England’s self-appointed task of preparing India
for self-government. All that I can be certain of
is that the overtones of his speech were loud with
the White Man’s Burden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a time when I should have preferred
to this rather snuffling enunciation of pious hopes
and high ideals a more brutally “realistic” outburst
in the manner of Mussolini. But that was
long ago. I have outgrown my boyish admiration
for political cynicism and am now an ardent believer
in hypocrisy. The political hypocrite admits
the existence of values higher than those of
immediate national, party, or economic interest.
Having made the admission he cannot permit his
actions to be too glaringly inconsistent with his professed
principles. With him there are always “better
feelings” to be appealed to. But the realist,
the political cynic, has no “better feelings.” A
Mussolinian Viceroy would simply say: “We are
here primarily for our own profit, not for that of
the inhabitants of the country. We have immense
force at our disposal and we propose to use it
ruthlessly in order to keep what we have won. In
no circumstances will we give away any of our
power.” To such a man it is obviously useless to
talk about democracy, self-determination, the
brotherhood of man. He does not profess to feel
the slightest respect for any of these ideas; why
should he act as though he did? A politician who
professes to believe in humanitarianism can always
be reminded of his principles. He may not sincerely
or thoroughly believe in them—though no
man professes principles in which he has no belief
whatever—but having made professions, he is
afraid of acting in a manner too wildly inconsistent
with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The more cant there is in politics, the better.
Cant is nothing in itself; but attached to even the
smallest quantity of sincerity, it serves like a
nought after a numeral, to multiply whatever of
genuine goodwill may exist. Politicians who cant
about humanitarian principles find themselves
sooner or later compelled to put those principles
into practice—and far more thoroughly than they
had ever originally intended. Without political
cant there would be no democracy. Pecksniff, however
personally repulsive, is the guardian of private
morality. And if it were not for the intellectual
snobs who pay—in solid cash—the tribute which
philistinism owes to culture, the arts would perish
with their starving practitioners. Let us thank
heaven for hypocrisy.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>DELHI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Re-reading the preceding paragraph, I
wonder why I wrote it. No cant, no democracy:
therefore, let there be cant. The implication
of course is that democracy is something excellent,
an ideal to be passionately wished for. But after
all is democracy really desirable? European nations
certainly do not seem to be finding it so at
the moment. And even self-determination is not
so popular as it was. There are plenty of places
in what was once the Austrian Empire where the
years of Hapsburg tyranny are remembered as a
golden age, and the old bureaucracy is sincerely
regretted. And what is democracy, anyhow? Can
it be said that government by the people exists anywhere,
except perhaps in Switzerland? Certainly,
the English parliamentary system cannot be described
as government by the people. It is a government
by oligarchs for the people and with the
people’s occasional advice. Do I mean anything
whatever when I say that democracy is a good
thing? Am I expressing a reasoned opinion? Or
do I merely repeat a meaningless formula by force
of habit and because it was drummed into me at an
early age? I wonder. And that I am able to
wonder with such a perfect detachment is due, of
course, to the fact that I was born in the upper-middle,
governing class of an independent, rich,
and exceedingly powerful nation. Born an Indian
or brought up in the slums of London, I
should hardly be able to achieve so philosophical a
suspense of judgment.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>DELHI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Legislative Assembly passes a great many
resolutions. The Government acts on about
one in every hundred of them. Indians are not
very enthusiastic about their budding parliament.
It is not, perhaps, to be wondered at. Indian politicians
find it useful, I suppose, because they can
talk more violently within the Chamber than without.
The violent speeches are reported in the press.
It is all good propaganda, no doubt. But it is nothing
more. The Government Members are, of
course, well aware that it is nothing more. Some
do not even take the trouble to conceal their knowledge,
but adopt throughout the sittings of the Assembly
a consistently flippant attitude of amused
and secure superiority.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>DELHI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The wars of Troy had their Homer. But other
and more significant events, other cities vastly
greater have remained uncommemorated, in the
outer darkness that lies beyond the frontiers of the
little luminous world of art. Men, places, and
happenings do not always and necessarily get the
chroniclers they deserve. Shakespeare is without
his Boswell and his Holbein. The European War
has not, as yet at any rate, produced its Tolstoy or
its Goya. No Swift has reacted to modern America.
Nor, finally, has contemporary Delhi, nor the
new India of which it is the capital and epitome,
evolved its Marcel Proust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How often, while at Delhi, I thought of Proust
and wished that he might have known the place
and its inhabitants. For the imperial city is no
less rich in social comedy than Paris; its soul is
as fertile in snobberies, dissimulations, prejudices,
hatreds, envies. Indeed, I should say that in certain
respects the comedy of Delhi is intrinsically
superior to that which Proust found in the Faubourg
Saint Germain and so minutely analysed.
The finest comedy (I speak for the moment exclusively
as the literary man) is the most serious,
the most nearly related to tragedy. The comedy of
Delhi and the new India, however exquisitely diverting,
is full of tragic implications. The dispute
of races, the reciprocal hatred of colours, the subjection
of one people to another—these things lie
behind its snobberies, conventions, and deceits, are
implicit in every ludicrous antic of the comedians.
Sometimes, when a thunderstorm is approaching,
we may see a house, a green tree, a group of people
illuminated by a beam of the doomed sun, and
standing out with a kind of unearthly brightness
against the black and indigo of the clouds. The
decaying relics of feudalism, the Dreyfus case, the
tragedies of excessive leisure—these form the
stormy background to the Proustian comedy. The
clouds, against which imperial Delhi appears so
brilliantly comical, are far more black, far more
huge and menacing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In India I was the spectator of many incidents
that might have come straight out of “<span class='it'>A la
Recherche du Temps Perdu</span>”; trivial incidents, but
pregnant with the secret passions and emotions
which Proust could always find, when they were
there, beneath the most ordinary gestures, the most
commonplace and innocuous words. I remember,
for example, the behaviour of an Indian guest at
a certain hotel, where the European manager made
a habit of strolling about the dining-room during
meals, superintending the service, chatting with
the diners and, when they rose to leave, opening
the door to let them out. The Indian, I noticed,
never gave the manager a chance of opening the
door for him. When he wanted to leave the dining-room,
he would wait till the manager’s back was
turned and then fairly run to the door, turn the
handle and slip through, as though the devil were
after him. And indeed the devil was after him—the
devil in the form of a painful suspicion that,
if he gave the manager an opportunity of opening
the door for him, the fellow might make a humiliating
exception to his rule of courtesy and leave
it conspicuously shut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remember a dinner party at Delhi, at which
the embarrassment was all on the other side. An
Indian politician was the host; the guests, two
other politicians, a high English official, and ourselves.
It was a cheerful evening. With the roast,
the Indians began talking of the time they had
spent in gaol during the Non-Co-operation Movement.
It had been for them a not too uncomfortable
and even rather comical experience. They
were men of standing; it was only natural that
they should have been exceptionally well treated.
“Besides,” the eldest and most eminent of the politicians
explained, parodying the words of a Great
Mogul, “rivers of champagne had flowed between
me and Sir ——, who was the governor of the
province.” Rivulets, one gathered, continued to
flow, even in the prison. The conversation was
entirely good-humoured, and was punctuated with
laughter. But the English official listened with a
certain embarrassment. He was, after all, a member
of the executive which had had these men
thrown into gaol; and the fact that they had, on
the whole, enjoyed themselves in prison did not
diminish his indirect responsibility for their having
been sent there. Nor were the comments of
the Indians on the paternal and imprisoning government
any the less scathing for being uttered
with a laugh of good-natured derision. I did not
envy the official; his situation was dreadfully
ticklish. He was a guest, to begin with; moreover
the post he had occupied since the introduction
of the Montford Reforms officially imposed
upon him a behaviour towards Indian politicians
of more than ordinary courtesy and cordiality. He
existed, officially, to make the Legislative Assembly
work; he was there to lubricate the ill-designed
and creaking machinery of Indian parliamentary
government. It was impossible for him either in
his public or his private capacity to protest against
the remarks of the Indian politicians. At the same
time it was no less impossible for him, as a member
of the British executive, to accept or agree
with them. He adopted the only possible course,
which was to disassociate himself completely from
the conversation, to be as though he were not. He
did it, I must say, marvellously well; so well indeed,
that there was a certain moment (the Government
was catching it particularly hot) when
he seemed on the point of becoming invisible, of
fading out altogether, like the Cheshire Cat. I
admired his tact and thanked God that I was not
called upon to exercise it. The lot of the modern
I.C.S. official is not entirely enviable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then there were the Maharajas. The
Chamber of Princes—that remarkable assembly,
attended every year by a steadily diminishing
number of Indian rulers—was holding its sittings,
while we were at Delhi. For a week Rolls-Royces
were far more plentiful in the streets than Fords.
The hotels pullulated with despots and their viziers.
At the Viceroy’s evening parties the diamonds were
so large that they looked like stage gems; it was
impossible to believe that the pearls in the million-pound
necklaces were the genuine excrement of
oysters. How hugely Proust would have enjoyed
the Maharajas! Men with a pride of birth more
insensate than that of Charlus; fabulously rich,
and possessing in actual fact all the despotic power,
of which the name of Guermantes is only the faint
hereditary symbol; having all the idiosyncrasies
and eccentricities of Proust’s heroes and none of
their fear of public opinion; excessive and inordinate
as no aristocrat in the modern West could
hope to be; carrying into Napoleonic or Neroian
actuality the poor potential velleities towards active
greatness or vice that are only latent in men who
live in and not above society. He would have
studied them with a passionate interest, and more
especially in their relations—their humiliating and
gravely ludicrous relations—with the English. It
would have charmed him to watch some Rajput
descendant of the Sun going out of his way to be
agreeable to the official who, though poor, insignificant,
of no breeding, is in reality his master;
and the spectacle of a virtuous English matron,
doing her duty by making polite conversation to
some dark and jewelled Heliogabalus, notorious
for the number of his concubines and catamites,
would have delighted him no less. How faithfully
he would have recorded their words, how
completely and with what marvellous intuition he
would have divined the secret counterpoint of their
thoughts! He would have been deeply interested,
too, in that curious unwritten law which decrees
that European women shall dance in public with
no Indian below the rank of Raja. And it would,
I am sure, have amused him to observe the extraordinary
emollient effects upon even the hardest
anti-Asiatic sentiments of the possession of wealth
and a royal title. The cordiality with which people
talk to the dear Maharaja Sahib—and even,
occasionally, about him—is delightful. My own
too distant and hurried glimpses of the regal comedies
of India made me desire to look more lingeringly,
more closely, and with a psychological eye
acuter than that with which Nature has grudgingly
endowed me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remember so many other pregnant trifles—The
pathetic gratitude of a young man in an out
of the way place, to whom we had been ordinarily
civil, and his reluctance to eat a meal with us, for
fear that he should eat it in an un-European fashion
and so eternally disgrace himself in our eyes. The
extraordinarily hearty, back-slapping manner of
certain educated Indians who have not yet learned
to take for granted their equality with the ruling
Europeans and are for ever anxious loudly to assert
it. The dreadfully embarrassing cringing of
others. The scathing ferocity of the comments
which we overheard, in the gallery of the Legislative
Assembly, being made on the Indian speakers
by the women-folk of certain Government Members.
Listening, I was reminded of the sort of
things that were said by middle class people in
England about the workmen, at the time of the
coal strike. People whose superiority is precarious
detest with passion all those who threaten it from
below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor must I forget—for Proust would have devoted
a score of pages to it—the noble Anglo-Indian
convention of dressing for dinner. From
the Viceroy to the young clerk who, at home, consumes
high tea at sunset, every Englishman in
India solemnly “dresses.” It is as though the integrity
of the British Empire depended in some
directly magical way upon the donning of black
jackets and hard-boiled shirts. Solitary men in
Dak Bungalows, on coasting steamers, in little
shanties among the tiger-infested woods, obey the
mystical imperative and every evening put on the
funereal uniform of English prestige. Women,
robed in the latest French creations from Stratford-atte-Bowe,
toy with the tinned fish, while the
mosquitoes dine off their bare arms and necks. It
is magnificent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost more amazing is that other great convention
for the keeping up of European prestige—the
convention of eating too much. Five meals
a day—two breakfasts, luncheon, afternoon tea, and
dinner—are standard throughout India. A sixth
is often added in the big towns where there are
theatres and dances to justify late supper. The Indian
who eats at the most two meals a day, sometimes
only one—too often none—is compelled to
acknowledge his inferiority. In his autobiography
Gandhi records his youthful lapses—after what
frightful wrestlings with his conscience!—into
meat eating. A fellow schoolboy led him into
the sin. Meat, the tempter speciously argued, was
the secret of English supremacy. The English
were strong because they ate so much. If Indians
would stuff themselves as imperially, they would
be able to turn the English out of India. Gandhi
was struck; he listened, he allowed himself to be
convinced. He ate—three or four times, at least.
Perhaps that is why he came as near as he did
to turning the English out of India. In any case,
the story proves how deeply the Indians are impressed
by our gastronomic prowess. Our prestige
is bound up with over-eating. For the sake of the
Empire the truly patriotic tourist will sacrifice his
liver and his colon, will pave the way for future
apoplexies and cancers of the intestine. I did my
best while I was in India. But at the risk of undermining
our prestige, of bringing down the
whole imperial fabric in ruins about my ears, I
used from time to time unobtrusively to skip a
course. The spirit is willing, but the flesh, alas,
is weak.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CALCUTTA</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Indian industrial workers are recruited from
the villages. Tradition is strong in the villages,
and the rules of conduct are religiously and therefore
ruthlessly enforced. When the pressure from
outside is relaxed and they find themselves enjoying
an unfamiliar freedom in the slums of the great
cities, these industrialised countrymen tend to go,
morally, to pieces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Contact with strangers who play the game of
life according to unfamiliar rules tends to weaken
the compulsive force of commandments which,
in the village, are unquestionably obeyed. For
moralities, however excellent and efficient each
may be when alone, are mutually destructive. They
are like spiders—cannibals of their own kind.
Brought into contact in the mind of a simple man,
they will devour one another and leave him without
any morality at all. And while it weakens the
countryman’s powers of resisting criminal temptations,
city life at the same time multiplies the opportunities
of profitable crime. In the village,
where the actions of each individual are known to
all the others, honesty, chastity, and temperance
are the best policy. In the slums of a huge city,
where every man is, so to speak, anonymous and
solitary in the crowd, they may easily cease to be
profitable. The honest, domestic, and temperate
countryman is too often transformed by contact
with the town into a thievish and fornicating
drunkard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The disturbing effects of a sudden change of
environment on even the tolerably well-educated
are always and everywhere apparent. On their
first arrival in Paris young English and American
men will behave as they would never dream of
behaving at home. Young women, too, one is
forced to add. It was ever so. St. Boniface writing
to the then Archbishop of Canterbury complained
that: “perpaucae sunt civitates in Longobardia
vel in Francia aut in Gallia, in qua non sit
adultera vel meretrix generis Anglorum, quod
scandalum est et turpitudo totius ecclesiae vostrae.”
That was 745 <span class='sc'>a.d.</span>; but the Saint might have been
prophetically describing the state of things in 1926.
The modern Italians tell an anecdote about a foreigner
who asked a Florentine acquaintance why
there were so few light and complaisant ladies to
be found in his otherwise admirable city. The
Florentine shrugged his shoulders. “Abbiamo le
Americane,” he explained. The story is doubtless
untrue; but it is significant that it should ever have
been invented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In India the importance to the individual of his
community with its traditional religion, its traditional
code of rules, is vastly greater than it is in
the West. Deprived of these supports, the Indian
finds it hard to stand. On him, therefore, the
effect of a change of environment from the village
to the distant city is generally much more serious
than it would be to a Westerner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The growth of industrialism in India has been
accompanied by a corresponding break up of rural
community life. Up to the present, however, industrialism
has made but small progress in India,
and village life as a whole is almost intact. But a
beginning has been made and we may divine from
Calcutta, Bombay, and Cawnpore what a largely
industrialised India might become. The prophetic
vision is not particularly inspiring. But material
conditions may be improved and I like to think
that the emancipation of a section of the population
from the bonds of community life may prove
in the end to be spiritually healthful. Up till now,
as any one who knows the slums of Indian industrial
towns will tell you, emancipation has only
been harmful. But in time, perhaps, the urbanised
peasant will learn to accommodate himself to liberty.
Freed from communal restraints, he may
learn to develop his own personal resources in a
manner hitherto unknown in rural India, where
the human unit has always been the community,
not the individual man or woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a pleasing hope and one to which, as a lover
of freedom and of change, a hater of fixity and
ready-made commandments, a believer in individuals,
and an infidel wherever groups, communities
and crowds are concerned, I cherish with a peculiar
fondness. Hinduism and the Indian village
system have been praised on the score that they
have preserved the Indian people and the Indian
character, have kept them unaltered and the same
through centuries of physical assault and spiritual
battery. To me the achievement seems more
worthy of blame than of praise. Fixity is appalling.
It is better, it seems to me, to be destroyed,
to become something unrecognisably different,
than to remain forever intact and the same,
in spite of altering circumstance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But these, no doubt, are jejune and romantic
prejudices, born of false notions regarding the end
and aim of human existence—of what is perhaps
the first and fundamental false notion that human
existence has any aim or end whatever, beyond its
own prolongation and reproduction. To one who
believes that man is here on earth to adventure,
to know, to try all things, to advance (if only for
the fun of advancing, of not standing still) towards
some quite unattainable goal of perfection,
the Indian scheme of existence will seem unsatisfactory
in the extreme. But if man (which may in
reality be the case) is born only that he may live
for a little, beget offspring, and die to make room
for those he has begotten, then the Indian village
community will seem the almost perfect form of
social organisation. In an Indian village men can
scratch up a living, breed, and die, without wasting
a particle of their energy on vain experiments, on
the pursuit of ideal will-o’-the-wisps, on the making
of progress foredoomed by nature and man’s
own destructiveness to lead nowhere. The only
real flaw that I can discover in Indian village life
is that it is profoundly boring. Change, incessant
experiment, the hunt for knowledge are interesting.
That is the best, perhaps the only, justification for
these things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That human beings will ever be able to dispense
altogether with the Indian village or its equivalent
seems doubtful. Man needs something outside
himself to hang on to—a stable society, a system
of conventions, a house, a piece of land, possessions,
a family. Already in the most completely urbanised
and industrialised parts of our world we can
find migrant populations of men and women, who
live in no place long enough to become attached
to it or influenced by its spirit, who own no land,
nor any tangible possessions—only the convenient
symbol of money—who have few or no children,
who believe in no organised religion. These people
are being compelled, by their mode of life, to
impose an enormous strain on their own resources
of mind and will, on personal relationships with
their fellows—on love, marriage, friendship, family
ties. They have nothing solid, outside themselves,
on which they can lean. The strain they
impose on them is often more than their spiritual
resources and their personal relationships will bear.
Hence a dissatisfaction, a shallowness of life, a profound
uncertainty of purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have always felt a passion for personal freedom.
It is a passion which the profession of writing
has enabled me to gratify. A writer is his own
master, works when and where he will, and is paid
by a quite impersonal entity, the public, with whom
it is unnecessary for him to have any direct dealings
whatever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professionally free, I have taken care not to encumber
myself with the shackles that tie a man
down to one particular plot of ground; I own
nothing, nothing beyond a few books and the motor
car which enables me to move from one encampment
to another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is pleasant to be free, when one has enough to
do and think about to prevent one’s ever being
bored, when one’s work is agreeable and seems
(pleasing illusion!) worth while, when one has a
clear conception of what one desires to achieve
and enough strength of mind to keep one, more
or less undeviatingly, on the path that leads to
this goal. It is pleasant to be free. But occasionally,
I must confess, I regret the chains with
which I have not loaded myself. In these moods I
desire a house full of stuff, a plot of land with
things growing on it; I feel that I should like to
know one small place and its people intimately,
that I should like to have known them for years,
all my life. But one cannot be two incompatible
things at the same time. If one desires freedom,
one must sacrifice the advantages of being bound.
It is, alas, only too obvious.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CALCUTTA</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Any given note of a melody is in itself perfectly
meaningless. A melody is an organism
in time and the whole, or at least a considerable
proportion of the whole, must be heard, through
an appropriate duration, before the nature of the
tune can be discovered. It is, perhaps, the same
with life. At any given moment life is completely
senseless. But viewed over a long period, it seems
to reveal itself as an organism existing in time, having
a purpose, tending in a certain direction. That
life is meaningless may be a lie so far as the whole
of life is concerned. But it is the truth at any given
instant. The note, A natural, is in itself insignificant.
But the note A natural, when combined in a
certain way with a certain number of other notes,
becomes an essential part of the “Hymn to Joy” in
Beethoven’s <span class='it'>Choral Symphony</span>. It is conceivable
that the moment of world existence, of which we
are each aware during a human lifetime, may be
an essential part in a musical whole that is yet to
be unfolded. And do the notes which we have
already deciphered in the records of history and
geology justify us in supposing that we are living
a melody—a melody almost infinitely prolonged?
It is a matter of opinion.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CALCUTTA</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The experimenter’s is a curious and special talent.
Armed with a tea canister and some
wire, with silk, a little sealing-wax, and two or
three jam-pots, Faraday marched forth against the
mysterious powers of electricity. He returned in
triumph with their captured secrets. It was just
a question of suitably juxtaposing the wax, the glass
jars, the wires. The mysterious powers couldn’t
help surrendering. So simple—if you happened
to be Faraday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And if you happened to be Sir J. C. Bose, it
would be so simple, with a little clockwork, some
needles and filaments, to devise machines that
would make visible the growth of plants, the pulse
of their vegetable “hearts,” the twitching of their
nerves, the processes of their digestion. It would
be so simple—though it cost even Bose long years
of labour to perfect his instruments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the Bose Institute in Calcutta, the great experimenter
himself was our guide. Through all an
afternoon we followed him from marvel to marvel.
Ardently and with an enthusiasm, with a copiousness
of ideas that were almost too much for his
powers of expression and left him impatiently
stammering with the effort to elucidate methods,
appraise results, unfold implications, he expounded
them one by one. We watched the growth of a
plant being traced out automatically by a needle
on a sheet of smoked glass; we saw its sudden,
shuddering reaction to an electric shock. We
watched a plant feeding; in the process it was
exhaling minute quantities of oxygen. Each time
the accumulation of exhaled oxygen reached a
certain amount, a little bell, like the bell that warns
you when you are nearly at the end of your line of
typewriting, automatically rang. When the sun
shone on the plant, the bell rang often and regularly.
Shaded, the plant stopped feeding; the bell
rang only at long intervals, or not at all. A drop
of stimulant added to the water in which the plant
was standing set the bell wildly tinkling, as though
some record-breaking typist were at the machine.
Near it—for the plant was feeding out of doors—stood
a large tree. Sir J. C. Bose told us that it
had been brought to the garden from a distance.
Transplanting is generally fatal to a full-grown
tree; it dies of shock. So would most men if
their arms and legs were amputated without an
anaesthetic. Bose administered chloroform. The
operation was completely successful. Waking, the
anaesthetised tree immediately took root in its new
place and flourished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But an overdose of chloroform is as fatal to a
plant as to a man. In one of the laboratories we
were shown the instrument which records the beating
of a plant’s “heart.” By a system of levers,
similar in principle to that with which the self-recording
barometer has made us familiar, but
enormously more delicate and sensitive, the minute
pulsations which occur in the layer of tissue immediately
beneath the outer rind of the stem, are
magnified—literally millions of times—and recorded
automatically in a dotted graph on a moving
sheet of smoked glass. Bose’s instruments have
made visible things that it has been hitherto impossible
to see, even with the aid of the most powerful
microscope. The normal vegetable “heart
beat,” as we saw it recording itself, point by point
on the moving plate, is very slow. It must take
the best part of a minute for the pulsating tissue
to pass from maximum contraction to maximum
expansion. But a grain of caffeine or of camphor
affects the plant’s “heart” in exactly the same way
as it affects the heart of an animal. The stimulant
was added to the plant’s water, and almost immediately
the undulations of the graph lengthened
out under our eyes and, at the same time, came
closer together: the pulse of the plant’s “heart”
had become more violent and more rapid. After
the pick-me-up we administered poison. A mortal
dose of chloroform was dropped into the water.
The graph became the record of a death agony.
As the poison paralysed the “heart,” the ups and
downs of the graph flattened out into a horizontal
line half-way between the extremes of undulation.
But so long as any life remained in the plant, this
medial line did not run level, but was jagged with
sharp irregular ups and downs that represented in
a visible symbol the spasms of a murdered creature
desperately struggling for life. After a little
while, there were no more ups and downs. The
line of dots was quite straight. The plant was
dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spectacle of a dying animal affects us painfully;
we can see its struggles and, sympathetically,
feel something of its pain. The unseen agony of
a plant leaves us indifferent. To a being with
eyes a million times more sensitive than ours, the
struggles of a dying plant would be visible and
therefore distressing. Bose’s instrument endows us
with this more than microscopical acuteness of
vision. The poisoned flower manifestly writhes
before us. The last moments are so distressingly
like those of a man, that we are shocked by the
newly revealed spectacle of them into a hitherto
unfelt sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sensitive souls, whom a visit to the slaughterhouse
has converted to vegetarianism, will be well
advised, if they do not want to have their menu
still further reduced, to keep clear of the Bose
Institute. After watching the murder of a plant,
they will probably want to confine themselves to
a strictly mineral diet. But the new self-denial
would be as vain as the old. The ostrich, the
sword-swallower, the glass-eating fakir are as cannibalistic
as the frequenters of chop-houses, take
life as fatally as do the vegetarians. Bose’s earlier
researches on metals—researches which show that
metals respond to stimuli, are subject to fatigue
and react to poisons very much as living vegetable
and animal organisms do—have deprived the conscientious
practitioners of <span class='it'>ahimsa</span> of their last hope.
They must be cannibals, for the simple reason that
everything, including the “inanimate” is alive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This last assertion may seem—such is the
strength of inveterate prejudice—absurd and impossible.
But a little thought is enough to show
that it is, on the contrary, an assertion of what is
<span class='it'>a priori</span> probable. Life exists. Even the most strict
and puritanical physicists are compelled, albeit
grudgingly, to admit the horridly disquieting fact.
Life exists, manifestly, in a small part of the world
we know. How did it get there? There are two
possible answers. Either it was, at a given moment,
suddenly introduced into a hitherto completely
inanimate world from outside and by a
kind of miracle. Or else it was, with consciousness,
inherent in the ultimate particles of matter
and, from being latent, gradually extrinsicated itself
in ever increasingly complicated and perfect
forms. In the present state of knowledge—or
ignorance, put it how you will—the second answer
seems the more likely to be correct. If it is correct,
then one might expect that inanimate matter
would behave in the same way as does matter which
is admittedly animate. Bose has shown that it does.
It reacts to stimuli, it suffers fatigue, it can be
killed. There is nothing in this that should astonish
us. If the conclusion shocks our sense of fitness,
that is only due to the fact that we have,
through generations, made a habit of regarding
matter, as something dead; a lump that can be
moved, and whose only real attribute is extension.
Motion and extension are easily measured and
can be subjected to mathematical treatment. Life,
especially in its higher, conscious forms, cannot.
To deny life to matter and concentrate only on its
measurable qualities was a sound policy that paid
by results. No wonder we made a habit of it.
Habits easily become a part of us. We take them
for granted, as we take for granted our hands and
feet, the sun, falling downstairs instead of up, colours
and sounds. To break a physical habit may
be as painful as an amputation; to question the usefulness
of an old-established habit of thought is
felt to be an outrage, an indecency, a horrible
sacrilege.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><span class='it'>Crains dans le mur aveugle un regard qui t’épie.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'>It was all very well from a poet. One could smile
indulgently at a pleasing and childish fancy. But
when it came to laboratory experiments and graphs,
things, it was felt, were getting more serious. It
was time to make a protest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Personally, I make no protest. Being only a
literary man and not one of those physicists, whose
professional interest it is to keep matter in its place,
with only such attributes as render it amenable to
mathematics, I am delighted. I love matter, I
find it miraculous, and it pleases me when a serious
man, like Bose, comes along and gives it a new
certificate of merit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the philosophy books matter is generally
spoken of slightingly, as something lumpish and
crude. To the subtlety of their own minds, on the
other hand, the metaphysicians can never pay a
sufficiently glowing tribute. But in reality—if I
may be pardoned the philosophically gross expression—it
is to matter, not mind, that the attributes
of subtlety, fineness, complexity belong. Our
mental picture of the world and its component
parts is a crude symbolical affair, having about as
much relation to the original as a New Guinea idol
to the human body. It is precisely because it is
so crude and simple that the thought-picture is
valuable to us. Reality—again I apologise—is infinitely
too complicated for our understanding.
We must simplify. But having simplified, we
ought not to say that those Papuan images of the
world, which are our philosophical and religious
systems, our scientific hypotheses, are subtle; they
are not. They are crude, compared with the original,
and it is, precisely, their crudeness which
gives them value, for us. Year by year, our world-picture
becomes increasingly complicated. More
details are noted in the original and are incorporated,
symbolically into the image. If the mind
of man develops and grows more subtle, that is
due to the fact that each succeeding generation is
brought up with a progressively more complete
and elaborate thought-picture of the world and all
its details. We think, we also feel, more subtly
and multifariously than did the ancients. To our
posterity, a thousand years from now, our subtleties
will seem, no doubt, most barbarously crude.
Perfection will be attained when mind has completely
understood matter and is therefore as delicate,
as complex, as variously rich as it. That is
to say, perfection will never be attained.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>ON THE HOOGLY</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The ship slides down the Hoogly, between the
mudbanks and the palms. Every now and
then we pass a village, a huge white jute mill.
Above the flat plain of the delta the sky is enormous
and peopled with majestic clouds. After these
months lived under a perpetually flawless blue, the
spectacle of clouds is a delight and a refreshment.
I understand, now, the inspiration of those Mogul
paintings, which represent princesses and great
lords looking at the clouds. A dry season in India
makes one long for a break in the monotony
of too perfect weather. Cloud-gazing, when at
last the approaching rains render it possible, must
be a most delicious pastime, particularly when combined
(as the Moguls in the paintings combine it)
with dalliance, the sipping of sherbet, and the slow
deliberate smoking of an enormous hubble-bubble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These clouds are messengers from the world that
lies beyond the borders of India; my pleasure at
seeing them is symbolical. For, to tell the truth,
I am glad to be leaving India. I have met old
friends in India, and made new friends; I have
seen many delightful and interesting things, much
beauty, much that is strange, much that is grotesque
and comical. But all the same I am glad
to be going away. The reasons are purely selfish.
What the eye does not see, the heart does not
grieve over. It is because I do not desire to
grieve that I am glad to be going. For India is
depressing as no other country I have ever known.
One breathes in it, not air, but dust and hopelessness.
The present is unsatisfactory, the future dubious
and menacing. The forces of the West have
been in occupation for upwards of a century and
a half. And yet five generations of peace and settled
government have made the country, as a whole,
no more prosperous than it was in the days of
anarchy; according to some authorities, such as
Digby, they have made it much poorer. Millions,
at any rate, are still admittedly without enough to
eat, all their lives. Custom and ancient superstition
are still almost as strong as they ever were,
and after a century and a half of Western government,
nine Indians out of ten cannot read or write,
and the tenth, who can, detests the Europeans who
taught him. The educated and politically conscious
profess democratic principles; but their instincts
are profoundly and almost ineradicably aristocratic.
They desire, theoretically, to see the
country “progressing” in the Western sense of the
term; but the practical ambition of most of them is
to secure a quiet job without responsibilities or
risks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the mountains of unnecessary labour,
of evitable hardship and superfluous suffering are
piled up, patiently, higher and ever higher. Millions
upon millions are born and painfully live—to
what end? God knows, it is hard enough to
find a reason anywhere, West or East. But in India
there is no conceivable answer to the question,
at any rate in terms of the present existence.
Metempsychosis had to be invented and the doctrine
of <span class='it'>karma</span> elaborated with a frightful logic,
before the serried, innumerable miseries of India
could be satisfactorily accounted for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ship goes sliding down stream. The clouds
seem to beckon and lead on, away. To-morrow
we shall be at sea.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>RANGOON</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The precincts of the Shwe Dagon pagoda contain
the world’s finest specimens of what I
may call the merry-go-round style of architecture
and decoration. The huge bell-shaped spire, gilded
from top to bottom and shining, towards the sun,
with intolerable high lights, stands in the midst;
and round it are grouped the hundreds of subsidiary
shrines, elaborately fretted, glittering like
Aladdin’s cave at the pantomime with a gaudy
mosaic of coloured glass, gilded and painted, or
dark, with the natural colour of the teakwood
pinnacles and gables, against the golden shining of
the pagoda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems a sacred Fun Fair, a Luna Park dedicated
to the greater glory of Gautama—but more
fantastic, more wildly amusing than any Bank
Holiday invention. Our memories, after a first
visit, were of something so curiously improbable,
so deliriously and comically dream-like, that we
felt constrained to return the following day to make
quite sure that we had really seen it.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>ON THE IRRAWADDY</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Ancient geographers imagined a river running
completely round the earth. Travelling
up the Irrawaddy from Mandalay, I wished that
their fancy had been the truth. How delightful
it would have been to go on and on in that leisured
and comfortable paddle steamer, gliding calmly
through every temperature and nation, every city
of the earth, and every natural phenomenon! The
banks slide past, the country opens and shuts like
a fan, plays the peacock with its plains and avenues
and receding dykes. Turning deliberately,
the mountains exhibit, now one face, now another,
now a garment of sunset rose, now of black against
the stars, now of green, now of dim remote indigo
and purple. From time to time cities and villages
variously beckon. On jutting headlands the stumps
of ancient towers and temples look down and consider
the reflection of their irrevocably perished
splendour. And all the time the current symbolically
flows, the sailing ships, the rafts, the little
canoes approach, drift past, recede and vanish like
so many lives and loves. Such is river travelling
at its best, as it ought to be—as it certainly would
be, if the ancient geographers were right and the
earth were indeed girdled by a cosmic stream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The upper reaches of the Irrawaddy would certainly
form a section of this great imaginary river.
In their kind they are perfect. Between Mandalay
and Bhamo I found myself constantly reminded of
those strange and beautiful pages in which Edgar
Allan Poe describes “The Domain of Arnheim.”
It is long years since I read the story; but I remember
vividly the crystal river which gave access
to the domain, I remember the white sands,
the green and sloping lawns, the flowering trees,
the woods—all the natural beauties so artfully arranged.
For the domain of Arnheim was a masterpiece
in the art of landscape gardening; it was nature,
but composed; it was the non-human chaos
of the world informed by the spirit of man. The
hills and jungles of Upper Burma are savagely innocent
of human arrangement; but chance has
often contrived to group them significantly and
with art about their central river. Here, on a
certain calm evening, the water and the plain, the
distant mountains, the limpid greenish sky fell all
at once into ready-made Claude Lorraines; and the
white pagoda in the foreground, on the river’s
bank, was a fragment of ancient Rome, a ruin of
Carthage. Claude persisted for miles; and appropriately
enough, while we were steaming through
him, a cool delicious fragrance, like the scent of
distant tobacco flowers, haunted the air. It seemed
as though the spirit of his art were finding expression
in terms of another sense than that of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At another place the hills came nearer; the narrow
strip of plain between the river and their feet
was covered with teak trees, intensely and darkly
green. It was late afternoon; the trees shone in
the warm and level light, the hills behind them
were flushed and at a certain moment the vision
framed in the open window was a strong and glowing
Constable. And in the defiles, where the river
breaks through a range of hills and the thick multitudinous
jungle comes swarming down to the
water’s edge, each turn of the stream revealed a
rich fantastic composition—the composition of
some artist not yet born, but destined, it was
obvious, to be a master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But not every landscape is a work of art and
river travelling is not invariably delightful. So,
alas, we discovered, as we journeyed down stream
from Mandalay towards Rangoon. The weather,
as we advanced, grew almost hourly more oppressive;
the cattle and hides with which our streamer
was loaded, piercingly stank; the landscape was
almost as poor as the food. On either side of the
mile-wide river the country was mostly flat and
treeless. For a day we steamed through the pale
and arid hills of the Burma oil-fields. An immense
black smoke, visible through all a morning’s navigation,
streamed half across the sky. A strike was
in progress; the Burmese, who objected, justifiably
from all accounts, to the Wild West methods and
cinema manners of the American drillers, had committed
a murder and set alight to eight hundred
thousand gallons of petroleum. A spirited race,
the Burmese—a little too highly so, perhaps. But
whatever the rights and wrongs, in these particular
circumstances, of murder and arson, that streamer
of black smoke certainly did something to enliven
the prospect. I regretted it, when at last it sank
out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the monotony was not entirely without alleviations.
At Pakkoku, for example (Pakkoku,
which the French lady on the steamer would insist
on calling “Pas Cocu”—I suppose because her
husband so manifestly was one) an acrobat was
doing extraordinary things on a slack rope. At
another town, whose less significant name I have
forgotten, we stopped for several hours to embark
some scores of tons of monkey nuts. They were
bound for Rangoon and thence, I learned, for Marseilles,
where, in due course, they would be turned
into Pure Superfine Provençal Olive Oil. At a
village lower down the river, we shipped the best
part of a thousand lacquered kettle-drums—for
home consumption, I suppose. They were charming
instruments, shaped like enormous egg-cups—a
foot, a stalk, a bowl with the parchment stretched
across its mouth. What a cargo of potential Burmese
happiness we were carrying under those taut
diaphragms! But none leaked out into the ship.
It was an odious voyage, and when at last we
reached Prome, whence the railway starts for Rangoon,
it was with a feeling of profound relief that
we disembarked. Near the landing-stage stood
two tall trees, sparse-leaved against the sky, and
laden with an innumerable and repulsive fruitage
of sleeping bats. The sun was sinking. With the
waning of light, the bats began to stir. What had
seemed a vegetable unfolded and slowly stretched
a leathery wing. There was a sudden flutter, an
agitation of twigs, and two of the pendulous black
fruits came together and began to make love, head
downwards.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BHAMO</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Between the main street of Bhamo and the
river-bank, or what will be the river-bank,
after the rains—for at this dry season the water is
distant a hundred yards or more across a beach of
sand—lies a little plain of two or three acres. It is
a much trodden, dusty plat of land and, save for one
enormous tree growing in the midst, quite bare. It
is a fine tree, not at all tropical in aspect, but oak-like,
with long limbs branching almost horizontally
from the trunk some fifteen or twenty feet above
the ground. The very image of those great trees
which, in Callot’s etchings, give shelter to the encamped
gypsies, protect the archers, as they do
their target practice on St. Sebastian, from the rays
of the sun, or serve as convenient gallows for the
victims of war. But it was not alone the tree that
reminded me of Callot; it was its setting, it was
the whole scene. The river in its mile-wide bed,
with the flat fields beyond it, provided for the solitary
tree that background of blank interminable
extension, to which Callot was always so partial.
Nor was the bustle immediately beneath and
around the tree less characteristic than the blank
behind it. Horses and little mules stood tethered
beside their loaded pack-saddles. Men came and
went with burdens, or stood in groups round one
of the patient beasts. In the foreground food was
being cooked over a fire and, squatting on their
heels, other men were eating. Under the huge
tree and against the blank background of receding
flatness and empty sky, a multitudinous and ant-like
life was being busily lived. It might have
been the break up of a gipsy encampment, or the
tail end of Impruneta Fair, or a military bivouac
out of the <span class='it'>Miseries of War</span>. It might have been—but
in fact it was the starting of one of the caravans
that march, laden with cotton and Burmese silk,
Burmese jade and rubies, over the hills into China.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BHAMO</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Lying as it does but thirty miles from the
Chinese frontier, Bhamo is more than half a
Chinese town. On its northern fringes stands a
sizeable joss-house. The Chinese resort there to
pray, to burn candles and incense, to record their
wishes, and to discover by the religious equivalent
of tossing—heads or tails—whether the gods have
consented to their fulfilment. They go there also
to drink tea and gamble, even to smoke a quiet
pipe of opium. One spectral creature, at any rate,
was doing so when we walked through the temple.
Near him a group of his fellows were busily dicing;
blank-eyed, ivory-faced, he sat apart, remote, as
though he were inhabiting, as indeed he was, another
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The inner courts, the actual shrine of the joss-house,
were extravagant in their chinoiserie. Those
fretted roofs, those great eaves turning up at the
corners like horns, those tall thin pillars, those
golds and scarlets, those twilights peopled by
gilded images, serene or grotesque—all these
things, one felt, might almost have been designed
by Lady Orford, they seemed almost the <span class='it'>dix-huitième</span>
parody of Chinese art. Fantastic they
were, eminently amusing, even good in their way;
only the way happened to be rather a tiresome one.
But if, within, the joss-house was a Manchu extravagance,
without, it achieved the simple and supremely
elegant beauty of an earlier period. The
gate-house of the temple was a small white stuccoed
building, quite plain except for the raised panels
of brickwork which strengthened the angles of the
façade and, like the ornamental pilasters of our
classical architecture, served to underline the vertical
movement of the design. It was covered with
a low tiled roof, discreetly turned up at the corners,
that the dead horizontal line might be made supple
and alive. At the bottom, in the centre, one of
those circular gateways, to which the Chinese are
so partial, gave access to the inner courts of the
temple. Above and to either side of it a pair of
square windows lighted the upper floor. And that
was all. But the proportions were so perfect, the
gate and the windows so rightly placed, the faintly
curving roof so graceful, that the little building
seemed a masterpiece. Its simple and assured elegance
made me think of Italy—of little stucco
pavilions on the Brenta, of Tuscan and Roman
villas, of all those unpretentious yet beautiful, yet
truly noble houses which adorn the Italian countryside.
This Chinese gate-house was classical, the
product of an ancient and traditional art, slowly
perfected. Here in Burma, where the national
architecture is the architecture of the travelling
circus and the amusement park, it seemed doubly
beautiful. And when we went out into the streets,
we found the same perfected and classical beauty
for sale at every Chinese shop at two or three annas
a specimen. The little Chinese tea-cups of earthenware,
glazed white within, bird’s egg green without,
are the cheapest crockery, and among the most
beautiful, in the world. The Chinese shopkeepers
were all but giving them away. And the bowls
like eight-petalled flowers, painted with cocks and
roses, yellow and pale vermilion and green on a
softly glazed white ground—how much were we
asked for those? I forget; but it was certainly
well under sixpence apiece. Their beauty was
worth a little fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We spent a shilling and walked back to the
steamer, loaded with the lovely product of centuries
of human patience, skill, and genius. In
our cabin we unpacked our shillingsworth of
Chinese civilisation and examined it at leisure: it
was overwhelmingly impressive.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>ON THE IRRAWADDY</h2>

<p class='pindent'>My reading on the Irrawaddy was <span class='it'>The Glass
Palace Chronicle of the Kings of Burma</span>.
This curious work was prepared in 1829 at the
command of King Bagyidaw, who appointed a
committee of the most famous scholars to compile
a definitive and authoritative chronicle from the
existing records. The result is probably the most
learned edition of a fairy tale that has ever been
published.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Burmese fancy has a peculiar flavour of its
own. In the reigns of the good kings, for example,
there were repeated showers of gems, a phenomenon
of which I do not remember to have read in
the fabulous history of any other people. And
what remarkable things happened whenever a king
died! Sometimes it was merely a matter of smoke
issuing from the palace. But it was seldom that the
country got off so lightly; a royal death ordinarily
produced effects of a much more disturbing character.
Planets and even the Pleiades would pass
across the disk of the moon, or remain stationary
for as much as seven months at a stretch. Sometimes
the river would flow up country and light
would stream from the earth. Sometimes—a mystery
which the translator does not condescend to
explain—the <span class='it'>deinnatthè</span> coincided with the <span class='it'>thingyan</span>.
But perhaps the most unpleasant incident of
all occurred when King Hkanlat died. “About
the time of his death an ogre wandered laughing
over the whole country for full seven days; and
the people who heard the ogre’s laugh durst not
sleep.” Long live the King; the Burmese must
have repeated the loyal formula with a special and
peculiar fervour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This random selection of incidents from Burmese
history is sufficient, I think, to indicate the character
of the chronicle as a whole. It is a collection
of fabulous anecdotes. But the charm of the fabulous
quickly palls, and it would be impossible to
read more than a very few pages of the <span class='it'>Glass
Palace Chronicle</span>, if it were not for the solemn
absurdities introduced into it by the compiling
scholars. These learned men collated the several
sources of their chronicle with the most laudable
industry; they weighed the credibility of varying
texts; they applied the principles of Higher Criticism
to the ancient records and were bold to reject
even that which was old, if it offended against
reason and authoritative tradition. How learnedly
and with what sober criticism do they deal, for
example, with the story of the Naga princess who
had an affair with the Sun Prince and, in consequence,
laid a number of eggs which hatched out,
some into human children and some, surprisingly,
into iron and rubies! The comments of the scholars
are too long and too intricately learned to be quoted
in full. But this is how they deal with the question
of the Naga princess’s eggs:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“As for the statement that a human being was
born from the union of the Sun Prince and a female
Naga, these are the only parallel instances in the
books: in the <span class='it'>Bhuridatta Jataka</span>, the birth of a
human being after the father’s kind from the union
of a human prince with a female Naga and the birth
of a Naga after the father’s kind from the union of
Dhattharattha, the Naga King, with the Princess
Samuddaja; and in the <span class='it'>Mahavamsa</span>, such tales as the
birth of Prince Sihabahu after the mother’s kind
from the union of the human princess, daughter of
King Vangaraja, with a lion. Even if there were
real union between the Sun Prince and the female
Naga, either a spirit or a Naga should have been
born, after the kind either of the father or the
mother. Therefore, that a human son was born and
not a spirit, nor a Naga, is contrary to reason, and
this is a point of variance with the books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for the statement that one golden egg broke in
the land of Mogok Kyappyin and became stone,
iron and ruby, this land of Mogok Kyappyin being
thus singled out from among the fifty-six places of
precious stones on the surface of Jambadapa, it is
worth considering whether, in other places also, the
various kinds of gems, stones, iron, ruby, gold and
silver, and pearl, were likewise the result of the
breaking of a Naga egg. Not a shadow, not a
hint, the scholars vehemently conclude, appears
in the books that in all these fifty-six places a Naga
egg broke and became stone, iron, or ruby.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is crushing, it is utterly conclusive. The
female Naga and all her eggs must be rejected.
Reason and authority demand that we should accept
a more probable account of the origin of the
young Pyusawhti, the Prince who killed, with a
magic bow, the Great Boar, the Great Bird, the
Giant Tiger and the Monstrous Flying Squirrel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is as though a committee of Scaligers and
Bentleys had assembled to edit the tales of the
nursery. Perrault’s chronicle of Red Riding Hood
is collated with Grimm’s, the variants recorded,
the credibility of the two several versions discussed.
And when that little matter has been satisfactorily
dealt with, there follows a long and incredibly
learned discussion of the obscure, the complex and
difficult problems raised by Puss in Boots. What
language did the cat talk? And was he black or
tortoise shell, ginger or common tabby? Scaliger
inclines to Latin and tortoise-shell. Bentley, with
more weight of evidence, prefers black and Hebrew.
A pleasing fancy. But when we pass from
Red Riding Hood and Puss in Boots to the fables
of the Old Testament, the fancy becomes a fact.
In America it would appear, there are still people
who can discuss the first chapter of Genesis, the
stories of Noah and Joshua with all the earnest
gravity of Burmese pundits discussing the Sun
Prince and the eggs of the female Naga.</p>

<div><h1 id='pt-2'>PART II<br/> <span class='it'>Malaya</span></h1></div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PENANG</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Penang has a certain Sicilian air. It is a sort
of Palermo, lacking indeed the architecture
and the orange groves, those characteristically
Mediterranean amenities, but rich in a tropical
wealth of wicker huts and naked children, of coco
palms and jungle. Walking on the Peak, we found
ourselves at a certain point looking down an almost
precipitous ravine into the forest. We were
in a fold of the hills, shut off from the sea breeze.
It was prodigiously hot, and from the dense green
tangle below us there came up a thick and hardly
breathable steam, that smelt like that first hot and
sweetish puff of air which fills your nostrils and
condenses in blinding moisture on your spectacles,
as you open the door of the Great Palm House at
Kew Gardens. There could be no mistake this
time; we were genuinely in the tropics.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PENANG</h2>

<p class='pindent'>We were in Penang on the last day of the
Chinese New Year celebrations. The temples
were thronged with a crowd mostly of women
and young girls. They were exquisitely and richly
dressed. Gold pins and flowers were stuck in their
glossy black hair. Their earrings and bracelets
were of the translucent jade which commands
among the Celestials a price that seems to us
fantastic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what beauty, what a charm they had! From
the smooth ivory faces the bright and, for us at
any rate, strangely expressionless eyes looked out,
startlingly black against the pale skin. The lovely
and perverse creatures who float through Marie
Laurencin’s paintings have the same smooth whiteness
of cheek and forehead, the same black, bright
and bird-like regard. And the long slender Chinese
necks—these too were Laurencinian. And the exquisite
fine hands. But Marie Laurencin’s beauties
have a length of leg and a grace of movement in
which these charming Celestials were sadly lacking.
Chinese hands are generally beautiful, and
the gestures that are made with them have a wonderful
refinement, a traditional and artistic elegance.
But the walk of the Chinese woman is curiously
without grace. It is a toddle, charming and
appealing in its absurdity, but totally without dignity.
Their hands move classically and in the
Grand Manner; but their walk is trivially rococo.
They are, so to speak, High Renaissance from the
waist upwards and a Louis Philippe bibelot below.
The imperial deportment of the Indian woman
seems to be quite unknown among the Chinese.
But then the Indians, like the peasant women of
Italy, who bear themselves like queens, are accustomed
to carrying burdens on their heads. The
Chinese, so far as I know, are not. Nothing so
much improves the deportment as the balancing
of a six gallon jar on the crown of the skull. There
are plenty of European as well as Chinese ladies,
whose appearance would be vastly improved by a
daily performance of this exercise. It would as
effectively correct the western droop and slouch as
the Extreme Oriental toddle.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BETWEEN PENANG AND SINGAPORE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Our journey from Penang to Singapore began
at night. We were carried in darkness through
the invisible forest. The noise of the insects among
the trees was like an escape of steam. It pierced
the roaring of the train as a needle might pierce
butter. I had thought man pre-eminent at least in
the art of noise making. But a thousand equatorial
cicadas could shout down a steel works; and with
reinforcements they would be a match for machine-guns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Morning revealed the forest, hushed now under
the light. The railway line was a little groove,
scored through the growing layers of green down
to the red earth. Fifty yards to either side of the
train rose the walls of the cutting. Looking at them
I wondered where in this solid verdure the uproarious
insects found a place to live.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every tourist is haunted by the desire to “get
off the Beaten Track.” He wants, in the first place,
to do something which other people have not done.
The longing to be in some way or other unique
grows with every increase of standardisation.
American advertisers, whom it pays to be psychologists,
have understood this pathetic trait in the
character of their contemporaries. In what are,
for some reason, styled the “Better Magazines”
you will see dignified advertisements of motor cars,
overcoats, radio sets, note-paper, chocolates, whose
outstanding merit is announced to be their “exclusiveness.”
The word attracts a million buyers,
who cherish their mass-produced treasure as
though it were a masterpiece, and who feel proud—at
any rate until they meet a few of their fellow
buyers—in the “exclusive” possession of something
unique. The tourist is like the reader of advertisements.
He wants something for his money which
nobody else possesses. Everybody has been to
Rome; but few have visited Nepi. Java is well
known; but who has landed at Ternate or Lombok?
It is delightful to be able to get up in a
Western drawing-room and say: “When I was last
in the interior of Papua.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is not alone the desire to achieve uniqueness
that makes the tourist so anxious to leave the
Beaten Track. It is not the anticipated pleasure
of boasting about his achievements. The incorrigible
romantic in every one of us believes, with
a faith that is proof against all disappointments,
that there is always something more remarkable
off the Beaten Track than on it, that the things
which it is difficult and troublesome to see must
for that very reason be the most worth seeing.
Those who travel pursue some phantom which
perpetually eludes them; they are always hoping
to discover some mode of life that is somehow
fundamentally different from any mode with which
they are familiar; and they imagine that they will
be able, magically, as soon as they have found it,
to get into contact with this marvellous existence,
to understand and partake in it. In the obvious
places and on the Beaten Track, they never find
what they are looking for. On the Beaten Track,
through whatever part of the world it may lead,
men and women live always in very much the same
way, and there is no Open Sesame to their intimacy.
But perhaps off the Beaten Track, in the little out
of the way places, where the hotels are bad and
there are toads in the bathroom—perhaps where
there are no hotels, but only rest houses, with
centipedes—perhaps in the places where you must
bring your own tents and porters, with provisions
and ammunition for a campaign of weeks—perhaps
where there is nothing but the jungle and leeches,
serpents and precipices and vampires and an occasional
pygmy with a blow-pipe and poisoned arrows.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Perhaps. But even amongst the crocodiles
and the cannibals the secret still eludes you.
Life is still fundamentally the same. Men and
women are as difficult to know as ever—rather
more so, on the whole; for your knowledge of
Pygmy is rudimentary and the little people are
afraid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with such meditations that I allayed the
desire to leave the Beaten Track, which the spectacle
of the jungle had evoked in me. To be devoured
by leeches in the pursuit of something as
hopelessly unattainable as the foot of the rainbow—was
it worth it? Obviously not. And I thanked
heaven and the British Empire for the F.M.S.
railway. Still, I went on longing to get behind
that wall of green; I went on believing in the
teeth of my own denials, that there was something
miraculous and extraordinary in the other side.
Meanwhile the train steamed on towards Singapore;
an attendant from the restaurant car came in
to tell us that breakfast was ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little later my longings were cured, for the
time being at any rate, by the disappearance of that
which had aroused them. The jungle suddenly
vanished and its place was taken by interminable
rubber plantations. Even in maturity a rubber
plantation is a poor thing. In youth it is an eyesore.
Miserably scraggy little trees planted neatly
in rows flanked the railway and continued to flank
it during almost all the rest of the day. We rolled
through literally hundreds of miles of potential
Dunlops, of latent golf balls, and hot-water bottles
to be. I own no rubber shares and am a consumer
of tyres and crêpe soles. While admiring the
energy of those who have destroyed it, I regretted
the jungle. Here and there the train passed
through a stretch of country that had ceased to be
jungle and had not yet become plantation. The
forest has been burnt. A great tract of brown
desolation stretches away from the railway. The
dead stumps of trees still stand, the charred trunks
lie along the ground—the corpses and skeletons
of a forest. Soon they will have been rooted out
and dragged away. The Brazilian seedlings will
be planted and in 1932 or thereabouts another
million of goloshes and Malthusian squirts will be
distributed throughout a grateful world.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SINGAPORE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Cleared of the forests, tamed into park and
garden, this tropical land seems, under its
perennially clouded skies, a piece of temperate
Europe. From our windows we looked out on to
sloping lawns, set here and there with huge umbrageous
trees that looked almost like elms and
oaks. The clouds swam indolently overhead. A
thin haze stippled the distances and made them
tenderly dim. We might have been looking out
over a park in the Thames valley, but a Thames
valley, as you saw at a second glance, deliriously
dreaming of palm-trees and orchids, and where
the air was as warm as blood. It was into an
equatorial England that we had suddenly stepped.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BATAVIA, JAVA</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Near the Penang Gate lies an old brass cannon,
half buried in the mud. It has no history,
it is quite unornamental. A more commonplace
piece of ordnance never issued from an eighteenth
century arsenal. The world is full of such
old brass cannons. By all the rules it should have
been melted down long ago or stuck muzzle downwards
into the ground to serve as a post, or mounted
on a little wooden carriage and left in the weather
outside the door of a museum. But destiny decreed
otherwise. Instead of suffering any of the
ignominies usually reserved for its kind, this superannuated
popgun was turned into a god. It lies
there in the mud, wreathed with gardenias and
orchids and a whole conservatory of paper flowers.
The ground all about it is planted with long-stemmed
paper lanterns, and incense burns perpetually
before its muzzle. Two or three hawkers
are encamped all day beside it, under the trees,
like the sellers of books and plaster saints and
candles in the shadow of a cathedral. The sun
god’s worshippers are numerous; they do a roaring
trade in offerings and souvenirs. Great is the Cannon
of the Batavians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Javanese were once Hindus, as their neighbours
of Bali are to this day. But now, with the
other Malayan peoples of Sumatra and the peninsula,
they are Mohammedans. Mohammedans in
name, at any rate; for their monotheism is hardly
more than a varnish spread over cults much more
ancient and, in the tropical circumstances, much
more apposite. Pure monotheism is probably the
last religion that would suggest itself to the minds
of men living near the equator. In a tropical
jungle, only a blind deaf-mute could be a monotheist.
The woods are horrible; they teem with
countless small and separate mysteries—unaccountable
sights in the half darkness, inexplicable
sounds across the silence. Nobody with ears and
eyes could fail, in a jungle, to be a believer in
spirits, ghosts and devils. The Malays may call
themselves Moslems; but they are still, at heart
and by nature, animists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor is it to the spirits alone that they pay their
devotions. There is no God but God and Mohammed
is his prophet. No doubt. But a cannon
is cylindrical and, long before they became Moslems,
the Javanese were worshippers of the reproductive
principle in nature. An immemorial
phallism has crystallised round the old gun, transforming
it from a mere brass tube into a potent
deity, to be propitiated with flowers and little lanterns,
to be asked favours of with smoking incense.
Men come and, standing before the sacred symbol,
silently implore assistance. Women desirous of
offspring sit on the prostrate god, rub themselves
against his verdigrised sides and pray to him for
increase. Even white ladies, it is said, may be seen
at evening alighting inconspicuously from their
motor cars at the Penang Gate. They hurry across
the grass to where the God is lying. They drop a
few gardenias and a supplication, they touch the
God’s unresponsive muzzle; then hurry back again
through the twilight, fearful of being recognised,
of being caught in the flagrant act of worshipping
at the shrine of a God, who was being adored a
thousand generations before Adam was ever
thought of and beside whom the Gods of Zoroaster
and the Vedas, of Moses and Christ and Mohammed
are the merest upstarts and parvenus.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BATAVIA</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“In matters of commerce,” it was once affirmed,</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>“In matters of commerce the fault of the Dutch</p>
<p class='line'>Is giving too little and asking too much.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>But either things have changed since those lines
were written, or else the Dutch do not regard the
selling of food as commerce. For there are restaurants
in Holland where, for a remarkably reasonable
price, one may eat, not only much more,
but also much better food than can be had anywhere
else in the world. The five-shilling luncheon
at the Restaurant Royal at the Hague is at once
Gargantuan and delicious. For a foreigner, not
yet trained up to Dutch standards, the hors
d’œuvres alone are satiatingly sufficient. By the
time the sixth or seventh course has made its appearance,
he throws up the fork and retires, leaving
the inured Olympic athletes of the jaw and
stomach in undisputed possession of the restaurant.
For the hardiest of these heroes—and heroines—the
proprietors of the Royal provide a luncheon
at ten shillings; it must be almost time, when they
have finished eating it, to go and dress for dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My gastronomic experiences in Holland led me
to expect a no less fabulous profusion in Colonial
Java. But I was disappointed, or perhaps relieved,
to find that the hotels catered not for giants but for
men and women only about twice life size. The
only truly Rabelaisian feature of Javanese diet is
the Rice Table. The Rice Table must be seen,
and eaten, to be believed. Without the co-operation
of the gullet, faith cannot swallow it. I do
not even expect those who have never eaten a Rice
Table to believe my description. Marco Polo,
when he returned from the court of the Great
Khan, full of true stories and correct statistics,
was by his compatriots derisively nicknamed
“Marco Milione.” For the sake of the truth about
Rice Tables, I am prepared with old Mark Million
to be thought a liar; here then it is—the truth,
literal but unbelievable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is lunch time. You enter the dining-room of
the hotel. A little old yellow waiter, looking less
like a man than a kindly orang-utan, shaved and
with a batik handkerchief tied round its head,
shows you to your place, asks what you will eat.
You push aside the menu of the commonplace
European lunch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ane Rice Tafel for mich,” you say, combining
German and Lowland Scotch into what you believe,
quite erroneously, to be the language of
Holland. The kindly little monkey-man trots off,
smiling; it seems to please him when his clients
decide on the Rice Table. You wait. In a little
while the monkey-man’s embassy to the kitchen
has its effect. A waiter appears at your elbow
with an enormous cauldron of rice; you heap your
plate with it. He moves away. Immediately another
waiter takes his place, offering fish soup.
You damp your rice; the soup man goes. A dish
of chops at once replaces the tureen. Looking
round, you see that the chop carrier is standing at
the head of a long procession of Javanese waiters,
extending in unbroken line from your table right
across the dining-room to the kitchen door. Each
time you help yourself, the procession advances a
step and a new dish is presented. I took the trouble
one day to count the number of dishes offered
me. Twenty-six actually appeared before me; but
it was a busy day for the waiters and I do not
think I got all the dishes I was entitled to. They
included after the chops, two other kinds of meat,
two kinds of bird, a species of sausage; fish, both
fresh and dried; roast bananas; several kinds of
vegetables, plain and curried; two varieties of
salads; fried nuts; numerous pickles; jam; a queer
kind of unleavened bread, and various other things
which I cannot at the moment remember. All
these articles are thoroughly stirred in with the
rice on your plate—a trough would be a more suitable
receptacle—the napkin is tucked firmly into
place beneath the chin and leaning forward you
shovel the immense and steaming mound of food
down your throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Rice Table is really the only inordinate
feature of Dutch East Indian diet. The breakfast
table may be furnished with such ill-timed delicacies
as Edam cheese, gingerbread and liver sausage;
but the porridge, the cooked meats, the eggs
and fishes, the toast, the scones and marmalade of
the Anglo-Saxon breakfast are lacking. Afternoon
tea is strictly tea; one drinks, but one does not eat.
Dinner is perfectly normal and late supper is unknown.
Hotels within the British Empire may be
innocent of the Rice Table; but the total amount
of nourishment which they offer in the course of
each day, and which is consumed by their clients,
is decidedly greater than that which forms the
daily foundation of Greater Holland. With the
possible exception of the Americans, the English
are, I am afraid, the world’s heaviest eaters. They
call us in Italy “il popolo dei cinque pasti”—the
Five Meal People.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frenchmen and Italians eat normally a little
more than half the amount of food consumed by
prosperous Englishmen. Arabs and Indians about
a third or a quarter. Seeing that mental and bodily
efficiency can be attained and kept up on these
smaller quantities, it follows that at least half our
eating is a matter, not of hunger or need, but of
pure gluttony, of simple and uncontrolled hoggishness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gluttony is numbered among the Seven Deadly
Sins; but for some reason—perhaps because it is
now so universally practised in respectable society—the
sin is seldom denounced. Lasciviousness is
deplored by every one; anger with its attendant
violences, by a majority, at any rate in the Western
and democratic countries. But gluttony, the besetting
vice of our age—for never in the world’s
history have so many men and women eaten so immoderately
as they do now—gluttony goes almost
unreproved. In the Middle Ages on the other
hand, when food was scarce and over-eating singular
and conspicuous, gluttony was freely denounced.
Peace, prosperity, the colonisation of
new lands, refrigerators, easy transport and modern
agriculture have made food plentiful, at any rate
in the West. Gluttony being universal is scarcely
noticed, and all the fury of the moralists is spent
on other sins, especially lasciviousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the gravity of a sin is gauged by several
standards, which we employ, when we make our
judgments, either separately or together. We may
judge a sin, in the first place, by the degree of its
harmfulness to the society in which the sinner lives.
Thus, the sin of anger, when it leads to crimes of
violence, is harmful to the society in which the
angry man lives, and therefore grave. Avarice is
chiefly detested because it leads to theft, and dishonest
practices, which do mischief to the avaricious
man’s neighbours. And so on. The application
to each particular sin is easily made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But sin is not exclusively a social matter; its
gravity is also measured by the harm, mental or
physical (and the physical is always finally also a
mental mischief) it does to the sinner himself. The
first and axiomatic duty of a man is, I suppose, to
make the best use he can of such talents as he possesses,
to develop his latent powers and keep himself
at the highest pitch of efficiency. His first
duty, in a word, is to be himself. The majority
of human beings live in conditions which make it
impossible for them to be themselves. A slum is,
so to speak, an Original Sin common to all its inhabitants
and for which they are not individually
responsible. But a substantial minority of men and
women cannot plead the Original Sin of bad conditions
to excuse their failure to be fully themselves.
These are personally accountable. For to bury
talents, to frustrate development of one’s own powers,
to compromise the efficiency of mind or body
are sins. It is for this reason, rather than because
they do harm to others beside the sinner, that the
various forms of sloth, lust, intemperance and self-complacent
pride are sinful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Historical circumstances may cause the gravity
of sins to change at different epochs. Thus, in a
war-like society, whose very existence depends on
the courage and ferocity of the individuals composing
it, the sin of anger will not be a grave one;
nor will the crimes of violence which accompany it
be considered worthy of severe censure. Our Saxon
fathers could kill a man for a few shillings; the
punishment fitted the crime and was proportionate,
at that period, to the sin. Later in the history of
Western Europe there was a definite moment at
which lasciviousness became a much graver sin
than it had hitherto been. Before the introduction
of venereal diseases, a moderate lechery might do
a certain, but not very serious mischief to society;
but it did very little harm, either spiritually or
physically, to the lecher. Innocent of disease, a
temperately lascivious Greek was almost innocent
of sin. The Christians, as innocent at first of disease,
artificially invested the instinct with an aura
of personal and social sinfulness. Later when the
Crusaders returned with their deplorable souvenirs
of Oriental travel, pleasure really and indeed became
a crime. A single lapse, not a course of excesses,
could reduce a man to repulsive disfigurement,
madness, paralysis and death. Nor did he
suffer alone; he murdered his wife as well as himself
and condemned his children to blindness, deafness
and deformity. Mercury and arsenic have
done much to diminish the personal sinfulness of
a moderate lechery. Its social sinfulness is succumbing
to divorce and contraception, is dwindling
with the gradual decay of Christian intolerance.
The progress of medicine and common sense may
end by making us as innocent as were the ancient
Greeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, as I have already pointed out, a combination
of historical circumstances—a combination of
industrial prosperity with colonisation and imperialism,
of scientific agriculture with steam transport—that
made our modern gluttony possible. It
escapes censure, in our English-speaking countries,
at any rate, because it is universal in respectable
circles, because its evil effects upon society are not
immediately manifest, like those of avarice or anger,
and because it does not so immediately take its
toll from the individual as does excessive lechery
or the intemperate use of drugs. But though not
immediately manifest, the effects of gluttony are
none the less deplorable. A large proportion of
every man’s available energy, mental and physical
(it is the same) is exhausted in the process of an
interminable and unnecessary digestion. More or
less chronic costiveness reduces vitality by sending
a stream of putrefactive poison circulating through
the blood. The body is bloated with venom, the
mind darkened by the glooms and uncharitablenesses
that are the spiritual fruits of constipation.
Suffering, the glutton causes his neighbours to suffer.
And after forty or fifty years of gormandising,
a cancer makes its appearance and the victim of
gluttony bids a long and excruciating farewell to
the scenes of his vice. It was syphilis that turned
even moderate and occasional lechery into sin.
Cancer, which leaves the savage and the frugal
Oriental unscathed, but preys with ever increasing
fury on the overfed Westerner, is the last-paid
wage, the parting gift of a life of gluttony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much in the life of man to which we now attach
“spiritual” and transcendental values, might and
perhaps should be revalued in terms of hygiene.
Starting from the axiom that it is a man’s first duty
to use all his powers to the best purpose, to be as
completely as possible himself, we can re-interpret
a great deal of morality and religion as rules of
health for the attainment and keeping up of an
ideal efficiency. Many sins, it is obvious, make a
man physically unhealthy and therefore incapable
of doing or being his best—a burden to himself
and a nuisance to his neighbours. It is unnecessary
to labour the point. But vice compromises
other modes of healthful existence besides the
physical. Sin is visited by punishments more subtle
than constipation, venereal disease and all their
unpleasant spiritual concomitants. For example,
there are certain human potentialities which can
only be developed into actuality when the mind
is in a state of quiet. For those who live in a
state of agitation, certain kinds of serene and lasting
happiness, certain intellectual and creative
processes are impossible. Now it is precisely the
excessive indulgence of those natural proclivities
called “sins” that tends to keep the mind in agitation
and prevent a man from realising what are
perhaps the most important potentialities of
thought and happiness he holds within him. Sloth,
avarice, lechery and anger are hygienically unsound;
they dull the mind and trouble it, raise
mud, so to speak, by stirring. Reasonable activity
of a kind which it is possible to believe worth
while, a controlled temper, a chastity not so excessive
as to be harmful, a humility unpreoccupied
with the trivial fears, desires, and hopes which fill
the life of the vain and proud—these things are
hygienically sound, because they make it possible
for the man who practises them to realise the potentialities
which, were his mind kept by vice in
a state of agitated distraction, would perforce remain
latent and for ever unactual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mysticism, which is the systematic cultivation
of mental quietness, the deliberate and conscious
pursuit of the serenest kind of happiness, may be
most satisfactorily regarded as a rule of health.
Mystics attribute their happiness and their creative
powers to a union with God. The hypothesis is,
to say the least, unnecessary. Atheists and epileptics
have received inspirations which have never
been attributed to the Holy Spirit. Every symptom
of the trance—from the “sense of presence” to
total unconsciousness can be produced artificially
in the laboratory. The drug taker, the epileptic,
the suddenly “inspired” mathematician or artist,
the experimental psychologist differ from the religious
mystic only in their attitude towards the
mystical experiences which they all equally share.
Believing them to be divine, the religious mystic
cultivates his experiences, makes use of them to
bring him happiness and serenity. The others accept
them as merely curious sensations, like giddiness
or the hiccoughs, and do not attempt, therefore,
to make a systematic use of their experiences in the
conduct of their lives. In this they are wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are, I think, fairly safe in supposing that
religious mystics do not in fact unite themselves
with that impossible being, a God at once almighty
and personal, limited and limitless. But that does
not in any way detract from the value of mysticism
as a way to perfect health. No man supposes that
he is entering into direct communion with the deity
when he does Swedish exercises or cleans his teeth.
If we make a habit of Müller and Pepsodent, we
do so because they keep us fit. It is for the same
reason that we should make a habit of mysticism
as well as of moral virtue. Leading a virtuous and
reasonable life, practising the arts of meditation
and recollection, we shall unbury all our hidden
talents, shall attain in spite of circumstances to the
happiness of serenity and integration, shall come,
in a word, to be completely and perfectly ourselves.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BATAVIA</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Hygiene is doubtless an excellent thing. But
I begin to wonder, as I re-read the preceding
section, why I should have found it necessary to
insist on hygiene to the total exclusion of God.
Temperament, I suppose, is partly accountable.
But it is mainly an affair—as usual—of unreasoning
prejudices, the fruit of mental habits acquired
during childhood. Men who have had a certain
kind of training can see divinity, or the possibility
of it, everywhere. Those whose upbringing has
been of a different kind spend their whole lives
sterilising and hermetically sealing their universe,
so as to prevent any germ of godhead from entering
and breeding dangerously within it. They demand
that the cosmos shall be bacteriologically pure. No
life; hygiene, but at all costs not a god. Considered
dispassionately, this prejudice does not seem
to me any more worthy of respect than its opposite.
Indeed, it is probably much less respectable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact that men have had stupid and obviously
incorrect ideas about God does not justify us in
trying to eliminate God from out of the universe.
Men have had stupid and incorrect ideas on almost
every subject that can be thought about. They
have believed, for example, that the earth is flat
and that the sun revolves round it. But we do
not regard that as a valid reason for denying the
existence of astronomy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The belief that God is a person and that a real
personal contact can be established between him
and a human being is probably unfounded. We
are persons ourselves, and we therefore tend to see
all things in terms of personality. The uneducated
man of average intelligence tends, quite naturally
and as a matter of course, to interpret a thunderstorm
in terms of human feelings. Science provides
a different and more satisfactory interpretation.
All contemporary Western men and women
possess at least the rudiments of physical science
and the scientific habit of mind as an inheritance;
they have been brought up to think of nature in
terms of impersonal law, not in terms of anthropomorphic
passion. Not even the stupidest European
or American now imagines that a thunderstorm is
a manifestation of divine tantrums. But among
peoples brought up in a different way, only thinkers
of the highest genius can conceive of a thunderstorm
as a purely impersonal happening. There is
no well-established science of religion. The stupid
Westerner has almost no educational advantages,
when it comes to religious matters, over his savage
and Oriental brothers. His natural instinct is to
regard God as a person, and he has received no
training that might cause him to modify his first
spontaneous opinion as it has modified his natural,
untutored opinion about thunderstorms. Among
primitive peoples there arise occasionally men of
scientific genius who know, intuitively, the truth
about thunderstorms. Where God is concerned,
we are all more or less primitives; only the greatest
religious geniuses have any knowledge (and it
is knowledge of a personal, intuitive, hardly communicable
kind) of the truth about God. It is
significant that Buddha, whom one feels to have
been the most intellectually powerful of all the
great religious leaders, should have rejected completely
the idea of a personal God and gone beyond
it. Two thousand five hundred years hence the
majority of human beings may have arrived at the
position reached by Gautama two thousand five
hundred years ago. We like to speak of ourselves
as “moderns”; but in point of fact the vast majority
of us are the most barbarously primitive of
ancients.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BATAVIA</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Indian servants are scarcely more than pieces
of moving furniture. They have obliterated
themselves, and nothing remains in your presence
but a kind of abstract and unindividualised efficiency—or
inefficiency, as the case may be. But in
Burma and throughout Malaya, wherever the servants
are Chinamen or Malays, you become aware
that the machine which makes your bed or pulls
your rickshaw or waits upon you at table is human
and has no desire to suppress the fact. Its eye is
critical; the expressions on its face are comments
on your words and actions. And when you walk
in the streets you have an uncomfortable feeling
that you are being judged and condemned to an
eternal derision. The European woman is generally
unaware in India that the attendant machine is
a man; the thing is reliably sexless. The Burman,
the Chinaman, the Malay, who have no knowledge
of caste and consider themselves the equals of any
man or woman, give no such comfortable assurance
of sexlessness. To discover humanity—and of the
most “human,” the all too human variety—in what
you have been accustomed to regard as a labour-saving
device is rather disquieting.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BATAVIA</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At Weltevreden there is a plot of ground dedicated
to the pleasures of the natives and called
the Gambier Park. At the entrance gate you pay
according to your nationality—Javanese five cents,
foreign Orientals (Chinese or Arab) fifteen, and
Europeans, half a gulden. We admitted the equitableness
of the tariff—for in every tropical land
the poorest people are always the inhabitants—shouldered
the white man’s burden to the tune of
fifty cents apiece and walked in. The thick, almost
palpable darkness of a night overcast by tropical
clouds was tempered by a few sparse arc lamps
and by the dim lanterns of mineral water vendors.
Their light was reflected from puddles; it had been
raining. The night felt and smelt like a hothouse.
It seemed strange to be walking in the open. Surely
there was a glass roof just overhead, there were
glass walls all round us. And where were the hot-water
pipes?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of drums and bamboo xylophones,
that tinkled out the endless and incoherent music
of a dripping tap, drew us across the grass. Under
a bright light twenty or thirty Javanese young men
and girls were gravely dancing. Nobody spoke.
They went through their evolutions without a
word. I was reminded of the noiseless coming and
going of an aquarium, of the mute ecstasies of
embracing octopuses, of submarine battles, ferocious
but inaudible. It is a strangely silent people,
the Javanese. Some merman, perhaps, from the
soundless depths among the corals was the first
colonist of the island. We stood for some time
watching the dumb Tritons in their batik skirts
or trousers, the voiceless but, I am afraid, far from
respectable nereids. Then, since one easily tires
of goldfish, we strolled away in search of livelier
entertainment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But mum was still the word. Fifty yards away
we found an open-air picture show. A crowd, as
fishily dumb as the young dancers, stood or
squatted in front of an illuminated screen, across
which there came and went, in an epileptic silence,
the human fishes of a cinema drama. And what a
drama! We arrived in time to see a man in what
the lady novelists call “faultless evening dress,”
smashing a door with an axe, shooting several other
men and then embracing against her will a distressed
female, also in evening dress. Meanwhile
another man was hurrying from somewhere to
somewhere else, in motor cars that tumbled over
precipices, in trains that villains contrived to send
full tilt into rivers—in vain, however, for the hurrying
young man always jumped off the doomed
vehicles in the nick of time and immediately found
another and still more rapid means of locomotion.
We did not stay to witness the foregone conclusion;
but it was sufficiently obvious that the man in the
hurry would find an aeroplane which would duly
crash on the roof of the house where the distressed
female was being embraced against her will. He
would rush in and be just in time to prevent the
consummation of a long protracted rape. (I may
add parenthetically that rape, on the cinema, is
always providentially leisurely; the villain takes
things so easily that heroes invariably have the time
to drive in Straight-Eights from Salt Lake City
to New York before the virtuous resistance of the
heroine can be overcome.) The villain would then
be shot and the young man and distressed female
would embrace, lengthily and with gusto, over his
carcase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The violent imbecilities of the story flickered
in silence against the background of the equatorial
night. In silence the Javanese looked on. What
were they thinking? What were their private
comments on this exhibition of Western civilisation?
I wondered. In North Africa, in India,
I have also wondered. There are many races,
skins of many shades; there are the colonies of
many white nations, there are protectorates and
mandated territories; there are nominally free
countries that give “concessions”—a great variety
of political institutions and subject peoples. But
there is only one Hollywood. Arabs and Melanesians,
negroes and Indians, Malays and Chinamen—all
see the same films. The crook drama at
Tunis is the same as the crook drama at Madras.
On the same evening, it may be, in Korea, in
Sumatra, in the Sudan they are looking at the
same seven soulful reels of mother love and adultery.
The same fraudulent millionaires are swindling
for the diversion of a Burmese audience in
Mandalay, a Maori audience in New Zealand.
Over the entire globe the producers of Hollywood
are the missionaries and propagandists of white
civilisation. It is from the films alone that the
untaught and untravelled member of a subject race
can learn about the superior civilisation which has
conquered and is ruling him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what does he learn from the films? What
is this famous civilisation of the white men which
Hollywood reveals? These are questions which
one is almost ashamed to answer. The world into
which the cinema introduces the subject peoples
is a world of silliness and criminality. When its
inhabitants are not stealing, murdering, swindling
or attempting to commit rape (too slowly, as we
have seen, to be often completely successful), they
are being maudlin about babies or dear old homes,
they are being fantastically and idiotically honourable
in a manner calculated to bring the greatest
possible discomfort to the greatest possible number
of people, they are disporting themselves in marble
halls, they are aimlessly dashing about the earth’s
surface in fast moving vehicles. When they make
money they do it only in the most discreditable,
unproductive and socially mischievous way—by
speculation. Their politics are matters exclusively
of personal (generally amorous) intrigue. Their
science is an affair of secret recipes for making
money—recipes which are always getting stolen by
villains no less anxious for cash than the scientific
hero himself. Their religion is all cracker mottoes,
white-haired clergymen, large-hearted mothers,
hard, Bible-reading, puritanical fathers and young
girls who have taken the wrong turning and been
betrayed (the rapes, thank goodness, are occasionally
successful) kneeling with their illegitimate
babies in front of crucifixes. As for their art—it
consists fin young men in overalls and large ties
painting, in cock lofts, feminine portraits worthy
to figure on the covers of magazines. And their
literature is the flatulent verbiage of the captions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such is the white man’s world as revealed by the
films, a world of crooks and half wits, morons and
sharpers. A crude, immature, childish world. A
world without subtlety, without the smallest intellectual
interests, innocent of art, letters, philosophy,
science. A world where there are plenty of motors,
telephones and automatic pistols, but in which
there is no trace of such a thing as a modern idea.
A world where men and women have instincts, desires
and emotions, but no thoughts. A world, in
brief, from which all that gives the modern West
its power, its political and, I like patriotically to
think, its spiritual superiority to the East, all that
makes it a hemisphere which one is proud to have
been born in and happy to return to, has been left
out. To the subject races of the East and South,
Hollywood proclaims us as a people of criminals
and mentally defective. It was better, surely, in
the old days before the cinema was invented when
the white men’s subjects were totally ignorant of
the world in which their masters lived. It was
possible for them, then, to believe that the white
men’s civilisation was something great and marvellous—something
even greater, perhaps, and more
extraordinary than it really was. Hollywood has
changed all that. It has scattered broadcast over
the brown and black and yellow world a grotesquely
garbled account of our civilisation. It has
published a journal of our activities, but heavily
censored. The political and scientific articles, the
reviews of books, the essays, the reports of learned
societies have been cut out; there are blanks where
the reproductions of the works of art should be.
Nothing has been left but the police court news,
the feuilleton, the reports of the divorce cases.
White men complain that the attitude of the members
of the coloured races is not so respectful as
it was. Can one be astonished?</p>

<p class='pindent'>What astonishes me is that the attitude remains
as respectful as it does. Standing in the midst of
that silent crowd of Javanese picture fans, I was
astonished when the performance attained its culminating
imbecility, that they did not all with one
accord turn on us with hoots of derision, with
mocking and murderous violence. I was astonished
that they did not all rush in a body through
the town crying “Why should we be ruled any
longer by imbeciles?” and murdering every white
man they met. The drivelling nonsense that flickered
there in the darkness, under the tropical
clouds, was enough to justify any outburst. But
fortunately for us, the Oriental is patient and long-suffering.
He is also cautious; for he knows, in
the words of Hilaire Belloc, that</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>Whatever happens, we have got</p>
<p class='line'>The Maxim-gun, and they have not——</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>“we” being the whites.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Maxim guns can check actions, but they cannot
control thoughts. The coloured peoples think a
great deal less of us than they did, even though they
may be too cautious to act on their opinions. For
this state of affairs the movies are not, of course,
alone responsible. The spread of native education,
the unedifying spectacle of the World War, the
talk about self-determination and the sacredness of
nationality, with promises of liberation made and
never carried into effect—these have done much,
perhaps most. But the share of Hollywood in
lowering the white man’s prestige is by no means
inconsiderable. A people whose own propagandists
proclaim it to be mentally and morally deficient
cannot expect to be looked up to. If films
were really true to life, the whole of Europe and
America would deserve to be handed over as mandated
territories to the Basutos, the Papuans and
the Andaman pygmies. Fortunately, they are not
true. We who were born in the West and live
there, know it. But the untutored mind of the poor
Indian does not know it. He sees the films, he
thinks they represent Western reality, he cannot
see why he should be ruled by criminal imbeciles.
As we turned, disgusted from the idiotic spectacle
and threaded our way out of the crowd, that strange
aquarium silence of the Javanese was broken by a
languid snigger of derision. Nothing more. Just
a little laugh. A word or two of mocking comment
in Malay and then, once more, the silence as
of fish. A few more years of Hollywood’s propaganda
and perhaps we shall not get out of an Oriental
crowd quite so easily.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>GAROET</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At this season of the year—which, the month
being March, I must call spring, though it is
never anything in Java but a more or less rainy
midsummer—at this season the hill station of
Garoet is like Paradise from dawn till lunch time
and like Scotland all the afternoon. You wake up
each morning to find the sky pale blue, the row of
jagged volcanoes opposite your bedroom window
all rosy with sunrise, the valley in the foreground
miraculously green. All morning a process of
cloud-making goes on. White mountains of vapour,
more fantastically shaped even than the rocks of
Java, build themselves up behind the volcanoes,
rise higher and ever higher into the sky, throw
off white islands from their summits to float out
into the welkin—until at last after a marvellous
drama of light and shadow, a slow soundless
pageant of ineffable illuminations and solemn
quenchings, the whole sky is overcast with vapours
that, from being white and sunlit, have almost suddenly
turned grey, and the whole scene below is
lifeless and sad. Punctually, at about two o’clock,
the first drops fall, and from that time forward
the rain comes pouring down with undiminished
violence till far into the night. The valley, the
volcanoes, the near palms and the bamboos disappear
behind grey veils of water. It is almost cold.
Looking out from your veranda, you might almost
believe you were sitting somewhere on the Moor
of Rannoch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what matters Rannoch all the afternoon, if
you may walk in Eden all the morning? Eden
indeed; for the whole impossibly beautiful land is
one great garden—but a garden on which, alas, the
curse of work has fallen most heavily. Tourists
in Paradise admire; but the gardeners labour incessantly.
The tourists’ white-skinned cousins duly
see to that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Garoet we walked out each morning among
the paradisiacal parterres. Every slope was terraced
and planted with rice; and at this season all
the terraces were flooded. Flights upon flights of
watery steps climbed from the valleys up the hillsides.
Lovingly they followed each contour of the
hill, making visible and, as it were, underlining
artistically the advance and recession of the curving
slopes. Some of the terraces shone within their
little retaining walls of clay, like mirrors of colourless
glass. In some the rice had already sprouted
and the surface of the water reflected innumerable
shoots of emerald. In little torrents, from the
mouth of bamboo conduits, the water poured and
splashed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But not all the fields were under water. In some
they were growing sugar-cane. In some they had
just cut the maize. We walked by little paths up
and down through the mountainous garden. Enormous
butterflies, their brown wings eyed with staring
purple; butterflies metallically blue; orange
and swallow-tailed; or richly funereal, as though
they had been cut out of black velvet; passed and
repassed with the strong swift flight of birds.
In the hedges, the hibiscus flowers hung open-mouthed
and their long pistils lolled like red and
furry tongues. A bush covered with little flowers,
star-shaped and many-coloured, blossomed along
every path. But brighter than the butterflies and
the flowers were the Javanese. Gaudy in their
batik and fantastically patterned, they passed along
the paths, they stood working in the fields. The
country swarmed with them. And every two or
three furlongs we would walk into a village—a
hundred little houses made of bamboo and thatch
and woven matting, perched on long stilts above
their artificial fish ponds (for almost every house
in Java has its muddy pool) and teeming with
copper-coloured life. Suspended from the tops
of long bamboos, the tame birds twittered in their
cages. And in larger cages, raised only a few feet
above the ground, we could see through the rattan
bars, not birds, but—astonishingly—tall piebald
sheep, one woolly prisoner in each cage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have never seen any country more densely
populous than Java. There are places within
thirty miles of London where one may walk for
half an hour without meeting a soul and almost
without seeing a house. But in Java one is never
out of sight of man and his works. The fields are
full of industrious labourers. No village seems to
be more than ten minutes’ walk from its nearest
neighbours. Authentically paradisiacal, the landscape
is very far from being a “bowery loneliness.”
By comparison with Java, Surrey seems underpopulated.
And for once, statistics confirm personal
impressions. The best part of forty million
people live on the island—the population of
crowded Italy in a mountainous land of half its
area.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, in the afternoons, the rain came down
and I had time to do something besides gasp with
admiration at the fabulous and entirely unbelievable
beauty of the landscape, I could not help
thinking about this portentous populousness. I remembered
those lines of Byron’s—if Byron indeed
it was who wrote that in every sense “curious”
poem, <span class='it'>Don Leon</span>—those classical lines, in which
the whole theory of overpopulation is briefly and
brutally summed up:—</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>Come, <span class='sc'>Malthus</span>, and in Ciceronian prose</p>
<p class='line'>Show how a rutting Population grows,</p>
<p class='line'>Until the produce of the Soil is spent,</p>
<p class='line'>And Brats expire for lack of Aliment.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>How soon the brats will start expiring in Java, I
cannot say. Into what is perhaps the most fertile
country in the world, they are already importing
food. But that means very little. Agricultural
methods may be improved; new lands opened up.
In the future, who knows? Java may support
eighty or a hundred, instead of a mere forty
millions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What interests me in the general problem is the
particular case of the child of talent born in the
lowest strata of an excessive population. What
are his chances of living, in the first place; of
developing and extrinsicating his talents, in the
second? Brats, <span class='it'>tout court</span>, constitute the stuff of
which our world is made. They may expire; but
unless they do so on such an enormous scale as to
imperil the whole fabric of society, it will make
no difference to the world. Brats of talent, on the
other hand, have it in them to change the world
in one way or another. The suppression of their
talent, by death or by the unpropitious circumstances
of life, deprives the world of part of its
vital principle of growth and change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lot of a human being born in the basements
of any population, whether excessive or small, is at
the best of times unenviable. Layer upon layer of
organised society lies above them; he is buried
alive under a living tombstone whose interest it is
to keep him buried. In the West, where the standard
of living is relatively high, where the State is
rich and humanitarianism is one of the principles
of government, the brat of talent is given certain
chances. The State provides certain educational
levers and pulleys for lifting the tombstone. The
child of talent—at any rate, if his talent happens to
be of the examination-passing variety—can worm
his way up quite early in life from the pit into
which he was born.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in the East universal primary education does
not exist, the State is not run on humanitarian
principles, and, even if it were would be too poor
to provide the brats of talent with the costly machinery
for lifting the tombstone. Nor, perhaps,
are the brats even conscious of a desire to climb
out of their grave. The bands of ancient custom
are wound round them like a shroud; they cannot
move, they do not wish to struggle. And then,
consider the weight of the tombstone. In China,
in India it lies like a pyramid upon them. Even if
he should survive infancy—and in an Oriental city
anything from three to nine hundred of every thousand
children die before completing their first year—how
can the brat of talent hope, unaided, to lift
the pyramid? Choirs of mute Miltons, whole regiments
of guiltless Cromwells are without doubt
at this moment quietly putrefying in the living
graves of China and lower-caste India.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Java, like all the other Malayan countries,
evolved no civilisation of its own, and its barbarous
record, so different from the splendid histories
of China and India, does not authorise us to
believe it fertile in men of talent. Still who knows
what genius may not by chance be buried under
the thick layers of its population? In the pyramid
above the grave of talent there are the best part of
forty million stones. If I were a Javanese patriot,
I should have that all too efficaciously fertilising
cannon at Batavia surreptitiously dragged from
its place by the Penang Gate and thrown into the
sea.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BUITENZORG</h2>

<p class='pindent'>There are days in our northern winter, still
days, windless, sunless and, from morning to
evening twilight, uniformly illumined under a
white-grey sky, days when the whole bare country
seems to glow, or to be just on the point of glowing,
with an intensity of suppressed colour. It is as
though a brown and earthy light were striving to
break from under the clods of every ploughland;
the green of the winter grass is a sulking emerald;
and the leafless trees and hedges, which seem at
first glance merely black, are seen by the more discerning
eye as the all but opaque lanterns through
which a strange, strong, quivering radiance of
deepest plum colour is almost vainly shining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Botanical Gardens at Buitenzorg, I found
myself unexpectedly reminded—in spite of the pervasive
greenness, the palms, the fantastic flowers—of
a winter scene in England. For the strong sullen
illumination, which I have tried to describe and
which is so characteristic of our December landscapes,
was the same as that which lay on these
tropical gardens. Under the white dead sky, the
colours potentially so much stronger than any that
are seen in our more rarefied landscapes, shone
with a dark intensity, muffled yet violent, as though
resentful of their suppression. We walked enchanted,
but in a kind of horror, under huge trees,
heavy with foliage that seemed as though darkly
and morbidly suffused with an excess of coloured
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when at last the sun came out, how unrestrainedly,
with what a savage and immoderate
exultation, the gardens responded to its greeting!
The hard and shiny leaves reflected the light as
though they had been made of metal, and burnished.
On every tree there hung, according to the
shape, the size and growth of its leaves, a multitude
of shining sequins, of scythes and scimitars, of daggers
and little ingots, a hundred various forms of
colourless and dazzling sunshine. And where the
leaves did not look towards the sun, their colour,
stripped by the light of all the veils which the
clouds had wrapped about it, glared out in all its
intensity: the violent blue-tinged emerald of equatorial
foliage.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>BUITENZORG</h2>

<p class='pindent'>There is a certain type of ingenious mind to
which the function of decorative and applied
art is simply and solely to make one object look
like another and fundamentally different object.
Wordsworth’s Needlecase in the form of a Harp
is classical. The same perverse ingenuity has begotten
and is still begetting monsters as silly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Personally, I have a weakness for these absurdities.
I love the stucco that mimics marble, the
washstands in the form of harpsichords, the biscuit
boxes that look like Shakespeare’s Complete
Works tied together with an embroidered ribbon.
My affection for these things prepared me to feel
a special admiration for the flora of the equator.
For the special and peculiar charm of tropical
botany is that you can never be quite sure that it
isn’t zoology, or arts and crafts, or primitive religion.
There are lilies in Malaya whose petals have
become attenuated to writhing tentacles, so that
they dangle on their stalks like perfumed spiders.
There are palms whose fruits are vegetable porcupines.
Dessert in Java is an affair of scarlet sea-urchins
and baked potatoes: open the first—it contains
the semblance of a plover’s egg, hard-boiled
and peeled of its shell; and the potato proves to be
full of a purplish custard flavoured with sherry,
turpentine and chocolate. There are orchids in
Singapore that might be pigeons, and others from
which one recoils instinctively as though from the
head of a snake. The gardens of the equator are
full of shrubs that bloom with votive offerings to
the Great Mother, and are fruited with coloured
Easter eggs, lingams and swastikas. There are
trees whose stems are fantastically buttressed to
look like specimens of a late and decadent Gothic
architecture; banyans pillared like the nave of a
basilica; <span class='it'>Fici Elastiae</span> that trail the ropes and halters
of a torture-chamber. There are red varnished
leaves and leaves of shiny purple that look as
though they were made of American cloth or
patent leather. There are leaves cut out of pink
blotting-paper; leaves mottled like the cover of
a school notebook; leaves whose green is piped
with lines of white or rose in a manner so sketchily
elegant, so daring, so characteristically “modern,”
that they are manifestly samples of the very latest
furniture fabrics from Paris.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>AT SEA</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At sea I succumbed to my besetting vice of reading:
to such an extent that the sand-fringed,
palm-crowned islands; the immense marmoreal
clouds that seem for ever poised, a sculptor’s delirium,
on the dividing line between chaos and accomplished
form; the sunsets of Bengal lights and
emeralds, of primroses and ice-cream, of blood and
lampblack; the dawns when an almost inky sea,
reflecting the Eastern roses from its blue-black
surface, turns the colour of wine; the stars in the
soot-black sky, the nightly flashings of far-away
storms beneath the horizon, the green phosphorescence
on the water—all the lovely incidents of
tropical seafaring float slowly past me, almost unobserved;
I am absorbed in the ship’s library.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ships’ libraries, I suppose, are bought either by
length or by weight. Stones of prime fiction, yards
of romance fill the shelves. The chief steward’s
key releases from their glass cages books which on
land one never sees, one hardly dreams of: books
about cow-punchers and sweet American heroines,
all in the Great Open Air; more serious and touching
novels about heroes who are misunderstood,
who have appearances against them and are suspected,
oh! quite unjustly, of cohabiting with pure
young ladies, and who are too virtuously proud to
explain, until they, the heroines and every one else
concerned have been put to the greatest possible inconvenience;
sociological novels about the Modern
Girl, the Poor, Night Life in London and a Decent
Day’s Work for a Decent Day’s Wage; innumerable
nondescript tales that end, instead of beginning,
with long slow kisses and arrangements for
the wedding. Amazing works! Drifting through
the tropics, I read them at the rate of three a day
and found the process a liberal education.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes, surprisingly, one finds a real book,
buried like a hard precious pebble in the spiritual
mud of the ship’s library. A real book. The discovery
comes as a shock. One feels like stout Cortez,
or Robinson Crusoe confronted by the footprints,
or Dr. Paley when he picked up that
symbolical half-hunter in the desert. What is it?
How did it get there? By accident or design?
In certain cases the questions admit of speciously
satisfying answers. Those George Eliots, for example,
so common in the Eastern seas—those can
be easily accounted for by the hypothesis of a new
edition, overprinted and remaindered. And perhaps
the mere cheapness of the Everyman volumes
would explain more than one appearance of Macaulay’s
<span class='it'>History</span>. Nor should one be too much
astonished at finding Anatole France on the ships
of the Rotterdam Lloyd; for the Dutch are polyglots
and believe in culture. Miraculously so, as
I discovered earlier in my wanderings. In Kashmir
I met a young and charming Dutch lady who
had just returned from a six months’ journey of
exploration in Chinese Turkestan. We were introduced,
entered into conversation; she began talking,
judiciously and in a flawless English, about
my last novel. I was extremely gratified; but at
the same time I was overwhelmed. If ever I go
to Chinese Turkestan, I shall return, I am afraid,
as deeply ignorant of contemporary Dutch fiction
as I was before I started. But if the presence of
<span class='it'>Thaïs</span> among the Dutch was explicable, the presence
of Edmund Gosse’s <span class='it'>Diversions of a Man of
Letters</span> in the library of a small Australian vessel
was almost terrifyingly unaccountable. And how
on earth did the <span class='it'>Howard’s End</span> of E. M. Forster
introduce itself into the coastwise traffic of Burma
and Malaya? How was it that Mark Rutherford
became a passenger from Sandakan to Zamboanga?
And why, oh why, was Bishop Berkeley travelling
from Singapore with his almost eponymous namesake
of <span class='it'>The Rosary</span>? After the first disquieting
bewilderment, I accepted the books with thankfulness,
and whenever I needed a little holiday from
my studies in popular fiction, turned to them for
rest and refreshment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the genuine books which I discovered
imbedded in a ship’s library was Henry Ford’s
<span class='it'>My Life and Work</span>. I had never read it; I began,
and was fascinated. It is easy enough in a book
to apply destructive common sense to the existing
fabric of social organisation and then, with the aid
of constructive common sense, to build up the scattered
pieces into a more seemly whole. Unsystematically
and in a small way I have done the thing
myself. I know how easy it is. But when Ford
started to apply common sense to the existing
methods of industry and business he did it, not in
a book, but in real life. It was only when he had
smashed and rebuilt in practice that he decided to
expound in a book the theory of his enormous
success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was somewhere between the tropic and the
equator that I read the book. In these seas, and
to one fresh from India and Indian “spirituality,”
Indian dirt and religion, Ford seems a greater man
than Buddha. In Europe, on the other hand, and
still more, no doubt, in America, the Way of Gautama
has all the appearance of the way of Salvation.
One is all for religion until one visits a
really religious country. There, one is all for
drains, machinery and the minimum wage. To
travel is to discover that everybody is wrong. The
philosophies, the civilisations which seem, at a distance,
so superior to those current at home, all
prove on a close inspection to be in their own way
just as hopelessly imperfect. That knowledge,
which only travel can give, is worth, it seems to
me, all the trouble, all the discomfort and expense
of a circumnavigation.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>MIRI, SARAWAK</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was on the point of raining when we anchored
off Miri. The grey sky hung only a few feet
above our masts; the sea below us was like grey oil,
and between the ceiling of shifting vapours and the
slowly heaving floor the air was unbreathable, like
the steam of a hot bath. Half a mile away across
the swell lay the land. The dark green forest came
down to the water; and in little clearings, conquered
from the trees, we could see a few dozens
of European bungalows, a score or two of miniature
Eiffel Towers marking the site of the oil wells
which have called Miri into existence, a few cylindrical
oil tanks, like white martello towers dotted
along the coast. Out at sea, opposite a cluster of
these white drums, a steamer lay at anchor; she
was loading a cargo of oil from the submarine
pipe-line, through which the wealth of Miri is
pumped into the tankers that take it to the outer—the
real—world. Beyond the near dark promontory
on the right we could see, far off and sun-illumined,
a range of fantastically jagged mountains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grey sky, grey sea, the forest, the oil wells in the
forest, the little houses among the ever-encroaching
trees, and beyond them, far away through the dim
hot air, the jagged mountains of Borneo—it was
mournful and sinister, abysmally unreal, the landscape
of a dream, of a bad dream at that. Then
the rain began to fall, a few warm drops, then a
shower; the mountains became the ghosts of themselves,
faded, faded and were gone. The shower
quickened to a downpour, and even the near coast,
the oil wells and the dolls’ bungalows, even the
black-green forest disappeared. Walled in by falling
water, we found ourselves at the centre of a
little universe, whose extremest limits were not a
furlong distant. It was a lively world; for in spite
of the rain our steamer continued to unload its
cargo into the attendant lighters. A good deal of
the cargo consisted of pork—in a potential and still
living form—for the consumption of the Chinese
coolies working on the oil fields. Each pig was
separately and closely packed in a rattan basket,
significantly shaped like the sausages into which
its tenant was to be so soon transformed. These
wicker sausages, with their living sausage meat
inside them and visible between the bars, were
swung out, ten at a time, by the crane and dropped
into the lighter. Three or four coolies were ready
to untie the bale and arrange the separate baskets,
layer by layer, in the wallowing barge. By the
time it was fully loaded, there must have been six
or seven successive strata of pig in the lighter.
There was little squealing or struggling inside the
baskets; for when unloading day arrives, the Chinese
take the precaution of putting a dose of opium
in the pigs’ breakfast. It was only when the crane
let them drop with a particularly violent bump
that the drugged beasts wriggled or uttered a grunt.
Mostly they lay quite still, dosing and perhaps deliciously
dreaming through the entire operation of
being swung through the air, let fall and dumped
or rolled into place above, between, below their
fellows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spectacle was curious and, though not precisely
pleasing, certainly less deplorable than that
which the man-handling of animals generally affords.
The pigs might be tossed about; but
plunged, like so many De Quinceys, in a trance of
opium, they were not aware of it. They might be
closely packed—much more closely, indeed, than
they could have been packed if they had been free
and struggling—but, stretched within their sausages
of rattan, they were neither crushed nor suffocated.
In a space where, unprisoned, no more
than twenty pigs could have stood, and that to the
greatest possible discomfort of each squealing victim,
a hundred were now conveniently packed. By
means of opium and baskets the Chinese have
solved a problem in humanitarianism as well as
economics.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>LABUAN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>There had been squabblings between the deck
passengers and the crew. We Olympians of
the saloon were aware of it only by a dim and remote
hearsay. But the fact was so true that, when
we put in at Labuan, the Captain thought it necessary
to pay off the two worst offenders among his
Malay sailors and turn them off the ship. They
took their pay, and one of them quietly departed;
the other refused to move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We saw him at a later stage of the proceedings—a
young man with a face like a copper statue’s, a
body classically built and dressed in the height of
Malay fashion. A superb specimen of humanity—but
he simply wouldn’t leave the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Captain sent for the dock police. Two of
them, looking very smart in khaki uniform, came
on board, took a good look at the young man, who
sat crouched in a dark corner, sullenly ruminating
his grievances, and having looked, retired. A little
later four more policemen joined them, and, standing
at a safe distance, the six representatives of law
and order cajolingly implored the young man to
come quietly. Nothing, they pointed out, was going
to be done to him; he was only being asked
to leave the ship; he had a right to a free passage
back to Singapore. The young man said nothing,
or only growled like a tiger. Discouraged, the policemen
reported to the Captain that they would
have to go and fetch the Resident in person: the
affair was too serious for them to deal with unsupported.
They trooped away. Still squatting in
his corner, the young man continued to chew his
bitter and maddening cud of grievance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We, being strangers to Malaya, began to wonder,
rather impatiently—for the obstinate young
man was delaying our departure—why something
decisive was not done about him. Nor could we
understand the obvious apprehensiveness of the
deck passengers and crew, the look of anxiety on
the faces of the officers. In our countries men
value life—their own, if not other people’s. Even
desperate criminals will generally come quietly
when they are cornered. To shoot and, sooner or
later, be shot, or hanged, would be easy. But the
respect and desire for life are too strong in them;
rather than violently resist, they acknowledge defeat
and go off resignedly to take the unpleasant
consequences of it. The Malay, on the contrary,
can easily work himself up into a state of mind in
which all life, including his own, seems to him
valueless, when the keenest pleasure and the highest
duty are to kill and be killed. Our young obstinate,
crouching in his corner and ruminating his
grievances, was busily preparing himself to run
<span class='it'>amok</span> at the slightest provocation from his enemies.
The six policemen, the deck passengers, the crew,
the officers—all knew it. The officers, indeed, had
reasons for knowing it particularly well. For it
was only a short time before that, on a ship belonging
to the same company as ours, a Malay
seaman had run <span class='it'>amok</span>, for some trivially inadequate
reason, and killed upwards of a dozen people,
including the Captain of the vessel. The Captain,
it seems, was a kindly old gentleman with
a snowy beard and Christian principles. He
was sent for when the trouble began, and found the
Malay knife in hand, and bloody. Instead of his
revolver, he used persuasion. He remonstrated,
he begged the Malay to be reasonable and give up
his knife. The Malay replied by sticking it into
his body. The deck looked like the last act of an
Elizabethan tragedy before he was finally shot
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had not heard this story at the time. Ignorance
is bliss, and we regarded our obstinate Malay
as a rather tiresome joke and wondered why every
one else took him so preposterously seriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Resident came at last; his forces amounted
now to no less than nine policemen. It was the
critical moment; the general anxiety was at its
height. Would the young heathen be got off the
boat without the shedding of blood? The pockets
of the Captain’s jacket were weighed down with
firearms; the Resident’s trousers bulged about the
hip. To have produced the pistols prematurely
would have been infallibly to provoke the Malay’s
insane fury. To pull them out too late would be
no less fatal. And to fire them at all in a small and
crowded ship would be a danger in itself. The
situation, for those who understood it and were responsible
for its developments, was disagreeably
ticklish. Ignorant, we looked on in amusement.
And luckily our attitude turned out to be the right
and appropriate one; the drama ended as a comedy,
not in blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the nine policemen went below to apprehend
him, the Malay slipped past them and came
bounding up the companion-ladder on to the
promenade deck. He probably had an idea that,
if he did come to running <span class='it'>amok</span>, it would be better
to kill first-class Christian passengers than third-class
Moslems and devil-worshippers. But he had
not yet quite succeeded in warming himself to
<span class='it'>amok</span> heat. Arrived on the top deck, the forces of
law and order at his heels, he glared about him,
but did nothing. There was a brief colloquy with
the Captain and the Resident. He stood there
obstinate; he continued to shake his head. He was
waiting, no doubt, for the divine afflatus that would
send him ecstatically slashing and stabbing among
the infidels. But the spirit of holy murder was
slow to descend. The Resident saw his opportunity,
nodded to his men; simultaneously the nine
policemen jumped on him. The Malay made a
grab for the dagger in his belt; but the spirit of
murder had arrived too late. The nine had him
fast. In another moment the handcuffs were round
his wrists.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The strained expression dissolved from every
face. Cigarettes were lighted, men began to smile,
to laugh and talk. And even the handcuffed captive
suddenly became good-humoured. The ferocious
young savage, who had been on the verge of
murder and self-destruction, was transformed, as
soon as it ceased to be possible for him to run <span class='it'>amok</span>,
into a merry boy. He spoke to the policemen, he
laughed; and they, in the profundity of their sense
of relief, laughed back at him, patted him on the
shoulder, loved him. He was led off, almost a
hero, down the gangway. In the midst of his
escort, and followed by all the children and idlers
of the town, he marched away down the road, towards
the police station—the most important man,
that afternoon, in Labuan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The incident, for us, was almost enjoyable. It
would have seemed a good deal less amusing if we
had heard before, instead of afterwards, the story
of the kindly old Captain, stabbed, with a dozen
others, on his own ship, within five miles of Singapore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The citizen of a law-abiding country, whose
forty millions commit each year fewer crimes of
violence than are committed in the single city of
Chicago, I realised suddenly and forcibly the precarious
artificiality of all that seems most solid and
fundamental in our civilisation, of all that we take
for granted. An individual has only to refuse to
play the game of existence according to the current
rules to throw the rule-observing players into bewildered
consternation. There is a rule against
violence, against taking the law into our own
hands; it is a rule which most of us observe—so
many, indeed, that a great number of people go
through life accepting orderliness and non-violence
as part of the scheme of nature. When somebody
comes into their orbit who plays the game according
to “the good old rule, the simple plan”—that
is, according to no rule—they are appalled, they
are at a loss what to do, they are helpless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The War did something to alter men’s attitude
towards the rules, but much less than might have
been expected. Men went into the fighting line
not, as our generals love to say when they make
speeches to public school boys, because “Man is a
Fighting Animal,” but because they were law-abiding
citizens obediently doing what the State
told them to do. It was the duty of the soldier
to commit violence and murder upon his country’s
enemies; but he did these things under orders, and
the doing of them hardly impaired his normal law-abidingness.
Considering the fact that, for four
years, half the grown men in Europe were engaged
in trying to murder one another, one can only be
astonished that the post-war increase in crimes of
violence has not been vastly greater. That it has
not is a proof of how deeply the habit of playing
according to the rules has become ingrained in us.
In America, the greatest part of which is removed
by only a couple of generations from the mediæval
epoch of pioneering, the habit of playing according
to the rules has not had time to become so
deeply ingrained as in the countries whose Middle
Ages of uncontrolled and lawless violence are five
hundred years away. Lynching, the Ku Klux
Klan, ferocious strike-breaking are American institutions,
the product of American history. In
England, where men abandoned the right to take
the law into their own hands some two or three
hundred years ago, they would be almost unthinkable.
Even crime is less bloodthirsty on our side
of the water; and the wholesale murderous banditry
that has filled the streets of American cities
with armoured cars and sharpshooters is all but
unknown with us. We are fortunate in our history.
How profoundly fortunate, this absurd, but potentially
tragical, incident at Labuan caused me
intimately to realise.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>LABUAN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>No good pictures have ever been painted, so far
as I am aware, of tropical landscapes. There
are two good reasons for this, which the first is that
no good painters have ever worked in the tropics.
True, the temples of Ceylon, the ghats at Benares,
Penang harbour, the palms and fantastic volcanoes
of Java are annually reproduced in fifty thousand
water-colours. But they are the water-colours of
amateurs. We have all seen them. They are the
stuff that oleographs are made of. If it were not
for the fact that they kept their creators harmlessly
busy and contented, they ought to be put down by
law. The tropics and the East are given over to
amateurs. Practically every tourist who travels
through them carries a paint-box. But how few
serious and competent professionals ever accompany
these tourists. It is difficult indeed to think
of any who have ever crossed the Line. Professional
painters of merit are generally poor, and
their absence from the tropics may be due in part
to their poverty. But poverty is not an insuperable
barrier to a determined artist, and the real reason,
I believe, why painters avoid the tropics is that
they know them to be unpaintable. In this intrinsic
unpaintableness consists the second and most
adequate reason for the non-existence of decent pictures
of tropical scenery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a significant fact that the scenery which the
enthusiastic amateur finds most picturesque, most
richly “paintable”—it is a favourite word of water-colouring
spinsters—is the scenery most carefully
avoided by serious professionals. Turner is one of
the few great landscape-painters who ever chose
to represent picturesque subjects. The rest have
always preferred to meditate before more ordinary,
less spectacular scenes. Italy offers extravagant
beauties; but the English have obstinately gone
on painting in the placid home counties of their
own islands; the French have never wandered
farther than to the bare hills of Provence; the
Flemings have found their subjects within a hundred
miles of Antwerp; the Dutch have stuck to
their polders and estuaries. Strange at first sight,
the phenomenon is easily explained. A picturesque
landscape (which is, by definition, a landscape
naturally possessing some of the qualities of
a man-made picture) is one which inevitably imposes
itself on the painter. In the face of its overwhelming
grandiosities, its naturally dramatic
character, its ready-made composition, he finds
himself being reduced to the rôle of a merely
passive recording instrument. That is all very well
for the amateurs. A picturesque landscape excuses
them from making any creative gesture of their
own; all they have to do is to sit down and faithfully
copy. But the serious painter does not want
to be imposed upon by his subject; he wants to
impose himself on it. He does not want to be
excused from making an effort of his own. On the
contrary, he feels impelled by his talent to make
the creative gesture which moulds the chaos of the
world into an ordered and human cosmos—which
turns nature into art. That is why he avoids the
rich, the picturesque, the imposing, the dramatic.
He wants a plain, and almost neutral subject, on
which he can impress his own human ideas of
composition and harmony, his own conception of
the grand and the dramatic. The quiet English
downland is less definitely formed than the prodigious
landscapes of the Alban Hills; Flanders and
the lower Seine are more malleable, so to speak,
more amenable to artistic treatment, than the Bay
of Naples; Delft is more easily digested by the intellect
than Tivoli. Turner, it is true, could swallow
Italy and turn it into art; but then he was a
kind of spiritual ostrich. Most painters prefer a
lighter diet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What is true of Italian is true, <span class='it'>a fortiori</span>, of
tropical landscape. The picturesqueness of the
most “paintable” parts of the tropical Orient is so
excessive, that the serious artist must feel, when
confronted with them, as though he were being
bullied, robbed of his initiative, dictated to. He
might enjoy looking at Java or Borneo; but he
would never dream of painting there. If he wanted
subjects to paint he would go back to Essex or
Normandy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tropical landscapes, besides being too picturesque
to be turned into good pictures, are also
too rich. Things in this part of the world have a
way of being unmanageably thick on the ground.
There is no room in a painting for the profusion
that exists in tropical reality. The painter of the
average tropical scene would have to begin by leaving
nine-tenths of reality out of his picture. That
was what Gauguin, one of the few good painters
who ever practised in the tropics, habitually did.
If he had not, there would have been no seeing the
wood for the inordinate quantity of the trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The various aspects of the tropical world still
await their interpreters. A hundred admirable
painters have taught us to know what European
landscapes really look like. But the artistic essence
of the tropical Orient remains to be distilled. Java
awaits its Gainsborough and its Constable; Benares
its Caneletto. Sportsmen are plentiful in the Malayan
forests, and sometimes they carry sketch-books
as well as rifles. But the Corot who will tell
us how those forests should be seen has not yet
walked among their green and leech-infested
shadows. We are compelled to see the tropics
either in terms of the snapshot, the amateur’s imitation
of the oleograph or of the steamship company’s
poster. Palm-trees, Reckitt’s blue sky, and
ocean, purple mountains, silver or golden sands—as
far as it goes, the steamship poster (which is
at least the work of a professional) is remarkably
truthful. When I saw the immense <span class='it'>Laconia</span> steaming
into the harbour of Labuan, I could have believed
myself in a London tube station, looking at
the advertisements of winter cruises in the South
Seas. But there is something more subtly and essentially
real to be got out of the tropics than the
amateur’s water-colour and the steamship poster—something
which we can all dimly recognise, but
to which no professional seer has yet taught us to
give a definite outline. English landscapes were
beautiful before Gainsborough was born, and men
were moved by the contemplation of their beauty;
but it was Gainsborough who made the loveliness
clearly visible, who gave it a name and a definition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The best pictures of the tropics are in books.
There is more of the essence and the inward reality
of the tropics in a book by Conrad or Herman
Melville, more in a good passage by H. M. Tomlinson,
more even in the rather maudlin Pierre Loti
than in any existing painting of the places they
describe. But description, even the description of
the most accomplished writers, is very unsatisfying
and inadequate. And it is no use practising
symbolical evocations on those who have never seen
the realities, which it is desired to evoke. For
those who have eaten a mutton pie, it is all very
well to speak of “dreams of fleecy flocks, pent in
a wheaten cell.” But we may be quite sure that
the congenital vegetarian would never succeed,
with the help of only this recipe, in preparing the
homely dish. The art of evocation is an admirable
one; but when there is nothing in the reader’s mind
to be evoked, it is practised in vain. It is no use
whistling to a dog which isn’t there. Symbolical
evocation will never create a true picture of the
tropics in the minds of those who have passed their
lives in Bayswater. No, the only way of explaining
to those who have never been there—as well as
to those who have—what the tropics are really like,
would be to distil them into pictures. The thing
has never been done, and it seems to me quite probable,
for the reasons I have already given, that it
never will be.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>KUDAT, NORTH BORNEO</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The steamers from Singapore call at all the
principal ports of British North Borneo. But
the tourist who supposes that he will be able, at
those places, to study those romantic beings “the
Wild Men of Borneo,” is profoundly mistaken.
At Kudat, it is true, we actually did see two small
and dirty people from the interior, hurrying apprehensively
along the relatively metropolitan
street of that moribund little port as though in
haste to be back in their forests. Poor specimens
they were; but we had to be content with them.
They were the nearest approach to wild men we
had seen or were destined to see, the only
genuine and aboriginal Borneans. For the rest,
we saw only Chinese. Except for a few Englishmen
they are the sole inhabitants of the ports.
Labuan and Jesselton, Kudat and Sandakan are
merely Chinese colonies. And behind the ports,
in the land that has been conquered from the forest—there
too they are to be found. With the
Javanese they work the big company-owned plantations,
they cultivate small holdings of their own.
And everywhere the shopkeepers, the merchants
are Chinese. It is the same all over the archipelago
and in the Malay peninsula. Not European
capital so much as Chinese labour and perseverance
is developing the East Indies. Abolish the
Chinese, and European colonisation would be impossible.
Or at least it would be a merely platonic
and honorary colonisation. Flags might be planted
without the assistance of the Chinese—but not rubber.
It is pleasant, no doubt, it is soul-satisfying
to look at the coloured bunting flapping in the
tropical breeze. But it is still pleasanter to draw
dividends. For this keener pleasure Europeans
must thank the Chinamen.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SANDAKAN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Sandakan, like Jesselton, Kudat and, I suppose,
all the other sea-coast towns of North
Borneo, is a Chinese colony governed by a few
white men inhabiting the bungalows in the suburbs.
It is a picturesque place, has a marvellous natural
harbour with a great red rock, like a second Gibraltar,
to guard its entrance, and is the port and
capital of a little hinterland of cocoanut groves,
rubber and tobacco plantations. A club-house and
a golf course proclaim it to be, if not a part of the
British Empire, at least a protectorate. (Examined
in detail and at close quarters, our far-flung Empire
is seen to consist of several scores of thousands
of clubs and golf courses, dotted at intervals, more
or less wide, over two-fifths of the surface of the
planet. Large blond men sit in the clubs, or swipe
the white ball down clearings in the jungles; blackamoors
of various shades bring the whisky and
carry round the niblicks. The map is painted red.
And to the casual observer, on the spot, that is the
British Empire.) But to return to Sandakan. Besides
a club and a golf course, it possesses four
steam-rollers and a superbly metalled road, eleven
miles long. At the eleventh milestone, the road
collides with what seems an impenetrable wall of
forest and comes abruptly to an end. You get out
of your car and, examining the wall of verdure,
find it flawed by a narrow crevice; it is a path.
You edge your way in and are at once swallowed
up by the forest. The inside of Jonah’s whale
could scarcely have been hotter, darker or damper.
True, the jungle monster sometimes opens its
mouth to yawn; there is a space between the trees,
you have a glimpse of the sky, a shaft of thick yellow
sunlight comes down into the depths. But the
yawns are only brief and occasional. For the
greater part of our stroll in the belly of the vegetable
monster, we walked in a hot twilight. It was
silent too. Very occasionally a bird would utter a
few notes—or it might have been a devil of the
woods, meditatively whistling to himself, as he
prepared some fiendishly subtle and ingenious
booby trap to terrify the human trespassers on his
domain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nature is all very well half-way to the pole.
Kept on short rations, she behaves decorously.
But feed her up, give her huge doses of the tonic
tropical sunlight, make her drunk with tropical
rain, and she gets above herself. If Wordsworth
had been compelled to spend a few years in Borneo,
would he have loved nature as much as he loved her
on the banks of Rydal Water? If the <span class='it'>Excursion</span>
had been through equatorial Africa, instead of
through Westmoreland, old William’s mild pantheism
would have been, I suspect, a little modified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with a feeling of the profoundest relief
that I emerged again from the green gullet of the
jungle and climbed into the waiting car. The
Chinese chauffeur started the machine and we
drove away, very slowly (for in Sandakan you
hire a car by the hour, not by the mile; the drivers
are marvellously cautious) we drove positively majestically
down the eleven-mile road. I thanked
God for steam-rollers and Henry Ford.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE SOUTHERN PHILIPPINES</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Dutch and English were never such
ardent Christians that they thought it necessary
to convert, wholesale and by force, the inhabitants
of the countries which they colonised. The
Spaniards, on the contrary, did really believe in
their extraordinary brand of Catholic Christianity;
they were always crusaders as well as
freebooters, missionaries as well as colonists.
Wherever they went, they have left behind them
their religion and with it (for one cannot teach a
religion without teaching many other things as
well) their language and some of their habits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Philippines were Spanish for upwards of
three hundred years. They were neglected, it is
true, they were governed at one remove, through
Mexico; still they were Spanish. That is a fact
of which you become aware the moment you set
foot on the island of Sulu, the southernmost and,
as it happens, the least Hispaniolised and Christian
of the Philippines. At Zamboanga you are made
more certain of it. At Manila it is fairly drummed
into you. The landscape is familiarly tropical and
East Indian. (Sulu is like a miniature Java, impossibly
beautiful.) But the world into which you
have stepped—you realise it at once—is unlike any
thing of which you have yet had experience in the
equatorial Orient. It is Spain—diluted, indeed,
distorted, based on Malayan savagery and overlaid
with Americanism, but still indubitably Spain. The
Dutch have been in Java for more than three centuries.
Their colonists have freely intermarried
with the natives; many have made the island their
permanent home, have lived and died there and
left their families behind them. But Java remains
Javanese. The people have retained their clothes,
their language, their religion; even in the towns, at
the cosmopolitan ports, they are totally un-Dutch,
just as the Malays of the peninsula, the Dyaks and
Dusuns of Sarawak and North Borneo are totally
un-English. If we had been as passionately Anglican
as the Spaniards were passionately Catholic,
the urban Malays would now be wearing cotton
plus fours, talking cockney and, on Sundays, singing
hymns A. and M. But—luckily or unluckily,
I do not know—we were only tepidly Anglican.
The Malay continues to wear his skirt, to talk
Malayan, to worship Mohammed’s new-fangled
Allah and the immemorial ghosts and devils of
his native forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Landing at Jolo (one pronounces it Holo), the
capital of Sulu island, we found ourselves in a
small decaying Spanish town. There were public
gardens with fountains and a group of comically
sublime and allegorical modern statuary. A noise
of nasal singing issued from a church; we looked
in and saw a choir of small brown urchins being
taught by a brown choirmaster to chant the
canticles and responses. Filipino ladies, dressed
like the beauties whose portraits one sees on the
inside of cigar-box lids, swam past. Their long
trailing skirts were looped up on one side to show
the under petticoat. Their bodices of stiff muslin
were amazing relics of the eighteenth century,
sweepingly cut to reveal a brown décolleté and
fitted with enormous puffed sleeves, like the wings
of butterflies or the fins of some more than usually
improbable kind of tropical fish. While the girls
and the younger women wore their hair “up,”
their elders, preposterously, kept it hanging in a
long black cataract down their backs. As for the
men, those who were not Filipinos and wearing the
most elegant of white duck suits, were dressed—it
depended upon their tribal and national affinities—either
in skin-tight fleshings, a gaudily coloured
sash or belt, a little toreador jacket and a coloured
bandana for the head, or else—flying to the other
sartorial extreme—in more than Oxford, more even
than Mexican trousers of brightly coloured silk
(pale pink, green, yellow, orange), a larger sash,
generally ornamented with an enormous kris, a still
more handsome bull-fighter’s jacket and, over the
bandana, a colossal hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fantastic garments! But surely not of indigenous
devising. Nowhere but in the Philippines do
the Malays dress themselves as toreadors and cowboys.
The least original of people, they have borrowed
their clothes from their conquerors and enemies.
The fancy dress of the Sulus and the fierce
proud Moros, who were the Spaniards’ most dangerous
foes, has been taken from a Spanish-Mexican
wardrobe. And that extraordinary swagger,
those noble attitudes—those too are Spanish. And
then the language. The country folk, of course,
have never learnt it. But it rumbles nobly in the
urban streets and shops. Nor, as we discovered,
is it the Filipinos alone who speak it. We had
made our way along the rickety wooden pier on
which, perched above the sea, the Chinese traders
have their shops and dwelling-houses, and were
seeking to buy some of those enormous pearl shells
for which the island of Sulu is celebrated. We
found them after much searching in the back rooms
of a Chinese shop—mountainous heaps of the shining
nacreous shells. We sifted the treasure and
selected as many as we wanted. Then came the
time to pay. We turned to the Chinaman. He
knew no English. Our two words of Malay were
spoken in vain. In despair we tried Spanish. He
responded. English and yellow Celestial, we conducted
our little haggle in pidgin Castilian.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>MANILA</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Manila is the capital of an American colony.
That is a fact of which I was not for long
permitted to remain in doubt. Within three hours
of my landing, I had been interviewed by nine
reporters, representing the entire press, English
and Spanish, of the city. I was asked what I
thought of Manila, of the Filipino race, of the
political problems of the islands—to which I could
only reply by asking my interviewers what <span class='it'>they</span>
thought about these subjects and assuring them,
when they had told me, that I thought the same.
My opinions were considered by all parties to be
extraordinarily sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When this sort of thing happens—and fortunately
it very seldom happens except on United
States territory—I am always set thinking of that
curious scale of values by which, in this preposterous
world, men and things are appraised. Take,
for example, the case of the literary man. (I am a
literary man myself, and so the matter interests
me.) The literary man is invested, it seems to me,
with a quite disproportionate aura of importance
and significance. Literary men fairly pullulate in
<span class='it'>Who’s Who</span>. They are more numerously represented
in that remarkable book than any other class
of notorieties, with the possible exception of peers
and baronets. Almost nobody who has sold five
thousand copies and had a good review in the
<span class='it'>Times Literary Supplement</span>, is missing from its
pages. A dispassionate observer from Mars would
be led, by a study of <span class='it'>Who’s Who</span>, to suppose that a
certain gift of the gab was the most important quality
an inhabitant of this planet could possess. But
is it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Art and the artist have become tremendously
important in our modern world. Art is spoken of
with respect, almost with reverence as though it
were something sacred; and every adolescent
aspires to be an artist, as regularly and inevitably
as every child aspires to be an engine-driver. Art
is one of the things that have flowed in to fill the
vacuum created in the popular mind by the decay
of established religion. The priest, whose confessional
functions have passed to the lawyer and the
doctor, has bequeathed his mystical prestige, his
dignity as a guardian of the sacraments, to the
artist. Hence the enormous number of literary
names in <span class='it'>Who’s Who</span>. Hence the interviewers
who flock to ask the wandering novelist his opinion
about things of which he must necessarily be incompetent
to speak. The obscure scientist, whose
mental equipment may be incomparably superior
to that of the literary man, is left in peace. The
public, being incapable of understanding what he
is talking about, takes no interest in him. He must
achieve something spectacular before hostesses ask
him out and reporters come to meet him at the
station. The practical man is hardly more esteemed
(unless, of course, he happens to be immensely
rich) than the man of science. To many people
a man who writes poetry (even very bad poetry)
and has an opinion about post-impressionism, is
necessarily more intelligent than even a first-class
engineer, or capable official, or the organiser of a
great industry. Doctors and mill owners, government
servants and lawyers can cross the seas without
running the slightest risk of being buttonholed
at every port by a crowd of newspaper men. They
may be more intelligent than the man of letters,
they may be better men doing work infinitely more
valuable than his. They may be qualified by special
knowledge to speak with authority about the
things which reporters love to discuss; but they
will be permitted to land unmolested. Their work
lacks the prestige which attaches to art; moreover
it is private work, confined to one place and to the
actual time of its achievement. The novelist’s
work is public; it exists simultaneously in many
thousands of places: it can be looked at over a long
space of time—as long indeed (if his vogue lasts)
as wood pulp can hold together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a mere spectator of the world, not an actor in
it—one who looks on and forms opinions of what
other people are doing, but does nothing himself—I
feel the profoundest admiration for those who
act, who impress their will on stubborn things, not
merely on yielding ideas, who wield power over
men directly, and not impersonally as the writer
does by wielding power over weak words. I admire
and envy; but I do not aspire to be their
rivals. Born a spectator, I should make the poorest
performer. I have a certain talent for using
the opera-glasses and making appropriate comments.
I have none for acting. It is better to be
content with doing what one can do, than to make
a fool of oneself by trying to do what one can’t.
If I were set down to do some of the serious practical
work that has to be done in order that spectators
can watch the comedy in safety and comfort,
I should behave like that Burmese king of whom
it is written in the <span class='it'>Glass Palace Chronicle</span>: “For
the sake of his concubines he composed the Paramatthabinda,
that they might know of mind and the
qualities of mind, matter, <span class='it'>nirvana</span>, forms of being
and personality. He would not even lend an ear
to the affairs of the villages or kingdom. Whenever
there was an enquiry to be made, power exercised,
or point of law determined, he caused his
son, Uzana, the heir apparent, to dispose thereof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I admire Uzana; but oh! I understand, I sympathise
with, I have a fellow-feeling for his poor
father. How infinitely pleasanter, if one happens
to be born with a speculative mind and a gift of
the gab, to chat with one’s concubines about <span class='it'>nirvana</span>
and the qualities of mind than to bother oneself with
the affairs of the villages! Uzana was undoubtedly
the better man; but his father, the distinguished
author of “Metaphysics in the Harem” and “Kant
for Concubines” must have been the one whom
everybody wanted to meet, who received letters
from distant female correspondents, who got asked
out to dinner, interviewed on the wharf and snapshotted
walking with a friend in the Park. All
these things would happen to him; and he—for I
take it that he had really and seriously thought
about the qualities of mind and the forms of matter—he
would be astonished every time and, thinking
of Uzana, he would feel embarrassed and even
rather ashamed, as though he were an impostor.</p>

<div><h1 id='pt-3'>PART III<br/> <span class='it'>The Pacific</span></h1></div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SHANGHAI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>I have seen places that were, no doubt, as busy
and as thickly populous as the Chinese city in
Shanghai, but none that so overwhelmingly impressed
me with its business and populousness. In
no city, West or East, have I ever had such an
impression of dense, rank, richly clotted life. Old
Shanghai is Bergson’s <span class='it'>élan vital</span> in the raw, so to
speak, and with the lid off. It is Life itself. Nothing
more intensely living can be imagined. There
are as many people—there are very likely more—in
an equal area of London or Lahore, of Glasgow
or Bombay; but there is not so much life. Each
individual Chinaman has more vitality, you feel,
than each individual Indian or European, and the
social organism composed of these individuals is
therefore more intensely alive than the social organism
in India or the West. Or perhaps it is the
vitality of the social organism—a vitality accumulated
and economised through centuries by ancient
habit and tradition—perhaps it is the intense aliveness
and strength of the Chinese civilisation, which
give to individual Chinamen their air of possessing
a superabundance of life beyond the vital wealth of
every other race. So much life, so carefully canalised,
so rapidly and strongly flowing—the spectacle
of it inspires something like terror. All this was
going on when we were cannibalistic savages. It
will still be going on—a little modified, perhaps, by
Western science, but not much—long after we in
Europe have simply died of fatigue. A thousand
years from now the seal cutters will still be engraving
their seals, the ivory workers still sawing and
polishing; the tailors will be singing the merits of
their cut and cloth, even as they do to-day; the
spectacled astrologers will still be conjuring silver
out of the pockets of bumpkins and amorous courtesans;
there will be a bird market, and eating-houses
perfumed with delicious cooking, and chemists’
shops with bottles full of dried lizards, tigers’
whiskers, rhinoceros horns and pickled salamanders;
there will be patient jewellers and embroiderers
of faultless taste, shops full of marvellous
crockery, and furriers who can make elaborate
patterns and pictures out of variously coloured
fox-skins; there will still be letter-writers at the
street corners and men whose business it is to sit
in their open shops inscribing words of ancient
wisdom on long red scrolls—and the great black
ideographs will still be as perfectly written as they
are to-day, or were a thousand years ago, will be
thrown on to the red paper with the same apparent
recklessness, the same real and assured skill, by a
long fine hand as deeply learned in the hieratic
gestures of its art as the hand of the man who is
writing now. Yes, it will all be there, just as intensely
and tenaciously alive as ever—all there a
thousand years hence, five thousand, ten. You have
only to stroll through old Shanghai to be certain
of it. London and Paris offer no such certainty.
And even India seems by comparison provisional
and precarious.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>JAPAN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was grey when we landed at Kobe, and the air
was cold and smelt of soot. There was deep
mud in the streets. A little while after we had
stepped on shore, it began to rain. We might have
been landing at Leith in the height of a Scotch
November.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lifted above the mud on stilt-like clogs, little
men paddled about the streets; they were dressed
in Inverness capes of grey or brown silk and cheap
felt hats. Women in dressing-gowns, with high-piled,
elaborately architectured hair, like the coiffure
of an old-fashioned barmaid, dyed black,
toddled beside them, leading or carrying on their
backs gaudily dressed children, whose round expressionless
button-faces were like the faces of
little Eskimos. It seemed, certainly, an odd sort
of population to be inhabiting Leith. Reluctantly
we had to admit that we were indeed in the Extreme
Orient, and the flowers in the shops had to
be accepted as a sufficient proof that this funereal
wintry day was really a day in the month of Cherry
Blossom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We got into the train and for two hours rolled
through a grey country, bounded by dim hills and
bristling with factory chimneys. Every few miles,
the sparse chimneys would thicken to a grove, with,
round their feet—like toadstools about the roots of
trees—a sprawling collection of wooden shanties:
a Japanese town. The largest of these fungus beds
was Osaka.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was late in the afternoon when we arrived at
Kyoto, the ancient capital, “the Art City of Japan”
(we had been well primed before starting with
touristic literature). Declining the proffered taxi,
we climbed into rickshaws, the better to observe
the town. It was only feebly drizzling. Dressed
like Anglo-Saxon messengers in blue jerkins and
tights, our coolies drew us splashing through the
mud. Kyoto is like one of those mining camps one
sees on the movies, but two or three hundred times
as large as any possible Wild Western original.
Little wooden shack succeeds little wooden shack
interminably, mile after mile; and the recession
of the straight untidy roads is emphasised by the
long lines of posts, the sagging electric wires that
flank each street, like the trees of an avenue. All
the cowboys in the world could live in Kyoto, all
the Forty-Niners. Street leads into identical street,
district merges indistinguishably into district. In
this dreary ocean of log cabins almost the only
White Houses are the hotels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few hours that evening it ceased to rain.
We took the opportunity to explore the city on
foot. The streets were well lighted, the shops—and
almost every one of the hundred thousand
shacks in Kyoto is a shop—were mostly open. We
walked through the city, seeing the commercial life
steadily and seeing it almost whole. It was like
walking, ankle-deep in mud, through an enormous
Woolworth’s bazaar. Such a collection of the
cheap and shoddy, of the quasi-genuine and the
imitation-solid, of the vulgar and the tawdry, I
have never seen. And the strange thing was that,
in Kyoto, even the real, the sound, the thoroughly
<span class='it'>pukka</span> had an air of flimsiness and falsity. Looking
at the most expensive kimonos with a lifetime
of wear woven into their thick silk, you would
swear that they were things of wood pulp. The
ivories resemble celluloid; the hand embroideries
have the appearance of the machine-made article.
The genuine antiques—the ones you see in the museums,
for there are none elsewhere—look as
though they had been fabricated yesterday. This
is due partly to the fact that in recent years we
have become so familiar with the conventional
forms of Japanese art turned out on machines by
the million for the penny bazaar market, that we
cannot associate them with anything but cheapness
and falsity; partly too, I think, to a certain intrinsic
feebleness and vulgarity in the forms themselves.
That sobriety, that strength, that faultless
refinement which are the characteristics of Chinese
art, and which give to the cheapest piece of Chinese
earthenware, the most ordinary embroidery or
carving or lettering, a magistral air of artistic
importance and significance, are totally lacking, so
it seems to me, in the art of Japan. The designs of
Japanese fabrics are garish and pretentious; the
sculpture even of the best periods is baroque; the
pottery which in China is so irreproachable both
in hue and shape is always in Japan just not
“right.” It is as though there were some inherent
vice in Japanese art which made the genuine seem
false and the expensive shoddy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Factories, smoke, innumerable Woolworths, mud—were
these Japan? We were assured they were
not. The “real” Japan (all countries have a “real”
self, which no stranger can ever hope to see) was
something different, was somewhere else. Looking
at the celebrated Cherry Dances in Kyoto, we were
almost ready to believe it. The costumes, it is true,
were extraordinarily vulgar and garish. The scenery
in Western style—the Western style of the pre-War
provincial pantomime—was deplorable. Any
self-respecting producer of revues in London or
New York could have staged a far more adequate
Old Japan. But he could not have got the dancing.
That was an enchantment. A chorus of thirty or
forty geishas, drilled to a pitch of almost Prussian
efficiency, their farded faces impassive as white
masks, performed a ballet that was the formalisation
of the gestures of courtesy, that was polite
conversation made more gracefully polite, that was
the apotheosis of good manners at the tea-table.
And hardly less lovely were the movements of the
orchestra. In Europe one pays to listen to music;
in Japan one pays to see it played. When European
performers make their appearance upon the platform,
one generally wants to shut one’s eyes; in a
Japanese concert room, on the other hand, one desires
to keep one’s eyes wide open and to close one’s
ears. Not that the music is unpleasant. What I
heard at Kyoto might have been the remote and
geological ancestor of Russian music. It stood in
relation to Rimsky Korsakoff as pithecanthropus
stands to man; it was a kind of <span class='it'>ur</span>-Stravinsky, a
fossil and primitive form of the genus Moussorgsky.
Not unpleasing, I repeat, but after a while a
little boring. The guitars, on which twenty geishas
played with plectrums that looked like ivory
combs, were singularly poor in tone. And the
tambourines, the cymbals and the drums, which
were being played by twenty of their sisters on
the opposite side of the hall, beat out only the
simplest and most obvious rhythms. No, the
orchestra was not much to listen to. But what a
ravishment to behold! They were as well drilled
as the ballerinas. The twenty guitar players sat
in identically the same position, and when they
combed the strings of their instruments their hands
performed the same movements simultaneously, as
though they were the synchronously moving parts
of one machine. Similar machines actuated the
eight hour-glass-shaped tambourines, the eight
small kettle-drums, the two sets of cymbals, the
two little gongs. Most exquisite of all were the
drummers. They knelt in front of their instruments
as though before a row of little gods. Each
held a pair of enormous white drumsticks, so thick
that the tiny hands could hardly grasp them. With
these, in unison, they tapped the little gods before
whom they knelt; and the little drum gods answered
them, boom boom—a response, it must be
admitted, rather more clear and comprehensible
than that which deities are accustomed to vouchsafe
to their worshippers. But then the ritual of
these Japanese adorers was so beautiful that it
could hardly fail to be magically compelling.
Their arms, prolonged by the enormous white
drumsticks, were held out before them almost at
full stretch. And when they beat, they beat from
the shoulder, lifting and letting fall the whole arm.
But “letting fall” is not the right expression; it
connotes a loose and undeliberate movement, and
the drummers did nothing undeliberately. On the
contrary, each stroke was applied with a perfectly
controlled precision. Tap, tap, tap-a-tap, tap;
they touched the drum face as though they were
fitting into position, one by one, the tesserae, now
large, now small, of an elaborate mosaic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps these dancers, these exquisitely disciplined
musicians, were the “real” Japan. Perhaps,
too, it existed in the country which we saw
on our way to Yokohama. The sun had come out
at last. The sky was palely blue and alive with
clouds that trailed great indigo shadows across
the earth beneath them. It was an almost Italian
country of abrupt hills and lakes and mountain-encircled
plains. A paler variety of our mustard
was blooming in the fields. Great expanses of
primrose yellow covered the plains to the edge of
the blue lakes, to the feet of the dim blue mountains.
The mustard seemed to me far more impressively
beautiful than the cherry blossom. The
near hills were brown, steep, almost bare, their
crests fringed with a growth, not of the Tuscan
umbrella pine, but of the trees which figure so
largely in the native woodcuts, the ragged, yet
strangely elegant, pine trees, whose silhouette
against the sky is like a Chinese ideograph. To
one familiar with the Celestial symbols, the whole
landscape, I liked to fancy, would be an open book.
Wisdom and poetry would sprout for him on every
hill. Or perhaps, who knows? the trees might
just be saying, “Foreign Devil, Foreign Devil,”
and repeating it monotonously, mile after mile.
The second, I am afraid, is the more probable
hypothesis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We rolled on, through miles of innumerable
little rice fields laboriously embanked to hold the
water with which they were being flooded; among
sloping plantations of tea shrubs, round and shinily
green, like bushes of clipped box; through luminous
plains of mustard and young green corn; past
villages of thatched houses beautifully set among
the trees. And every twenty miles or so, we would
catch glimpses of a thing which seemed, at first,
only a white cloud among the clouds of the horizon,
a pale small ghost, but a ghost which, at every
glimpse, became more definite, clearer, larger,
until—hours after we had had our earliest sight
of it—it stood shining high above us, a huge white
cone, girdled with clouds, a miracle of regular and
geometrical form among the chaotic hills which it
overtopped, the sacred mountain of Japan, Fujiyama.
We saw it first at noon, a tiny cloud melting
into the clouds; and at sunset we were looking
back on it, an enormous mass rising clear of all
vapours, naked and perfect, into the coloured sky.
Was this the “real” Japan? I suppose so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a little later, at Yokohama, we were plunged
again, head over ears, into the unreal. If Kyoto
looks like a mining camp, Yokohama after the
earthquake looks like a mining camp that has not
yet been finished. There are dust heaps among the
shanties, there are holes in the roadways, there are
unbuilt bridges. But in a little while, when the
mass is all cleared up and the damage repaired, it
will be just like Kyoto—miles of dreary ill-kept
roads, hundreds of thousands of ugly little wooden
shanties, and every shanty a shop and every shop a
Woolworth. But there are differences of quality,
there is a higher and a lower, even among Woolworths.
At Kyoto the shops had looked like three-penny
bazaars. At Yokohama they were only
penny ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We boarded our ship with thankfulness. “Real”
Japan had been delightful. But there had been
more of the unreal than of the real, and the unreal,
moreover, was obviously so much the more significant
and important that it had quite eclipsed the
real. In every country the places, the people, the
institutions which are said by lovers of that country
to constitute its “real” self are the least characteristic
and significant. Cornwall and county families
and the Anglican Church may be the esoterically
“real” England. But the England that matters,
that makes history, that impresses itself on the
world and casts its shadow into the future, is represented
by Lancashire, Trade Unions and Big Business
Men. It is the same, I suppose, with Japan.
Fuji and village life, traditional dances and cultured
gentlemen of leisure, are what the lovers of
Japan would have us believe to be the “real” thing.
But it is the unreal Japan, the wholesale producer
of shoddy, which is at present projecting itself on
history. Not the dancers, not the cultured and
religious gentlemen, but the manufacturers of
shoddy direct the country’s policy. And in the
enormous mining-camp cities more and more of the
Japanese are being transformed, for good or for
evil, from peasants and craftsmen into proletarian
factory hands, the brothers of all the other proletarian
workers of the world. The future of Japan,
as of every other country, depends on its “unreal”
self. Some day, in the Utopian future, when
things are very different from what they are now,
English and Japanese patriots, desirous of exalting
their respective countries, will point, not to
Cornwall or Fuji, not to the county families or
the descendants of the Tea Masters, but to Manchester
and Osaka, to the cotton spinners and the
weavers of silk. “Here,” they will say, “here is
the real England, the real Japan.” Progress may
be defined in this connection as the gradual transformation
of what we now call “unreal” into something
sufficiently noble and decent to be styled
“real.” Meanwhile we have the misfortune to
live in a world in which all that is historically
significant is so repulsive that we are compelled,
if we have any pride in our country or our human
species, to practise a wholesale Christian Science
on it and deny it reality.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>JAPAN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Accustomed to deploring and at the same
time taking advantage of the low standards
of living current elsewhere in the East, the traveller
who enters Japan is rudely surprised when he
finds himself asked to pay his rickshaw coolie a
wage which would not be despised in Europe. To
travel otherwise than by tram through the streets
of a Japanese city is a luxury. I was glad, for the
sake of the rickshaw coolies, that it should be so;
for my own, I must confess, I was sorry. To the
slave-owners, slavery seems a most delightful institution.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>ON THE PACIFIC</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Each evening before dinner as we zig-zag
down the long corridor towards our cabin,
now labouring uphill as the liner dips to port in
the slow swell, now racing downwards as it rights
itself and dips again to starboard, we hear behind
our neighbours’ closed doors a curious dry clicking
sound. It is a sound which, in a convent, one would
attribute to the rapid and multitudinous telling of
beads. But a liner is not a convent, and trans-Pacific
passengers are no more pious than ordinary
folk. Those clickings are not the record of muttered
<span class='it'>Paternosters</span> and high-speed <span class='it'>Aves</span>. They are
the sound of ice being rattled in cocktail shakers.
We are on an American ship, and when we want
to drink we must do so in our cabins and from
our own private cellars. And how ardently one
does want to drink when one is not allowed to. A
childish desire to do what is prohibited is stronger
than taste and habit. I, who abhor whisky, have
a large bottle of it in my trunk. And every evening
we gravely sit down in our cabin to drink
some of the champagne with which certain kind
American friends, with a thoughtful foresight born
of their knowledge of Prohibition, presented us
before we left Japan.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>AT SEA</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Familiarity blunts astonishment. Fishes do
not marvel at water; they are too busy swimming
in it. It is the same with us. We take our
Western civilisation for granted and find nothing
intrinsically odd or incongruous in it. Before we
can realise the strangeness of our surroundings, we
must deliberately stop and think.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But moments come when that strangeness is
fairly forced upon our notice, moments when an
anomaly, a contradiction, an immense incongruity
is suddenly illumined by a light so glaring that we
cannot fail to see it. Such a moment came to me
as I was crossing the Pacific. It was the first morning
out of Yokohama. Coming out of my cabin,
I was handed the day’s bulletin of wireless news.
I unfolded the typewritten sheet and read: “Mrs.
X, of Los Angeles, girl wife of Dr. X, aged 79,
has been arrested for driving her automobile along
the railroad track, whistling like a locomotive.”
This piece of information had been transmitted
through the ethereal holes between the molecules
of air. From a broadcasting station more than five
thousand miles away it had come to our ship in
rather less time than it would have taken the sound
of my voice to travel from one end of the promenade
deck to the other. The labours of half a
dozen men of genius, of hundreds of patient and talented
investigators, had gone to creating and perfecting
the means for achieving this miracle. To
what end? That the exploits of young Mrs. X,
of Los Angeles, might be instantaneously known
to every traveller on all the oceans of the globe.
The ether reverberated with the name of Mrs. X.
The wave that bore it broke against the moon and
the planets, and rippled on towards the stars and
the ultimate void. Faraday and Clerk Maxwell
had not lived in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wise men of antiquity (so say the Indians)
knew all that we have learned about nature, and
a great deal more besides. But they kept their
science to themselves, or revealed it only in enigmas
which cannot be interpreted except in the light of
a previous knowledge of the answers. They were
afraid that—men being what they are—their discoveries
might be put to bad or futile uses. The
ordinary man, they argued, is not to be trusted
with the power which comes of knowledge. They
withheld their science.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being prejudiced in favour of the West and of
the present, I have no great belief in the scientific
attainments of the ancient sages of the Orient. But
their wisdom is undeniable. The fruits of knowledge
are abused and wasted; it is, alas, only too
obvious. Disinterested men have given their lives
to the search for truth, and we have turned their
discoveries to the service of murder, or employed
them to create a silly entertainment. The modern
civilisation of the West, which is the creation of
perhaps a hundred men of genius, assisted by a few
thousand intelligent and industrious disciples, exists
for the millions, whose minds are indistinguishable
in quality from those of the average
humans of the palæolithic age. The ideas of a
handful of supermen are exploited so as to serve
the profit and pleasure of the innumerable subtermen,
or men <span class='it'>tout court</span>. The contemporary cave
man listens in on instruments which he owes to the
inspired labours of superior and, by comparison,
divine intelligences. Negroid music shoots across
the void into his ears, and the wisdom of such sages
as Dr. Frank Crane; racing results and bed-time
stories and the true tale of a young Mrs. X, of Los
Angeles. The fire of Prometheus is put to the
strangest uses. Gods propose, men dispose. The
world in which we live may not be the best of all
possible worlds: it is certainly the most fantastic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not being a superman myself, I took the liveliest
interest in young Mrs. X. After being arrested
for whistling like a locomotive—whether by
means of an instrument or with the unaided vocal
cords was never made clear—she was bailed out
of prison by her husband, the aged doctor. The
time came for the hearing of her case. Mrs. X
told the doctor that she proposed to forfeit her
(or rather his) recognisances and run away. The
doctor protested. Mrs. X then began to smash the
furniture. The aged doctor telephoned for the
police; they came, and Mrs. X was rearrested on
charges of assault. We on the Pacific waited in a
dreadful suspense. A few days later, as we were
crossing the hundred and eightieth meridian, we
learned to our profound relief that a reconciliation
had taken place. Aged Dr. X had withdrawn
his charge; the girl wife had gone home quietly.
What happened about the whistling business we
never learned. The anonymous powers which purvey
wireless news are strangely capricious. The
name of Mrs. X no longer rippled out towards
Aldeboran and the spiral nebulae. In the next
morning’s bulletin there was a little paragraph announcing
the declaration of the General Strike.
And Bébé Daniels had fallen off her horse and
received contusions.</p>

<div><h1 id='pt-4'>PART IV<br/> <span class='it'>America</span></h1></div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SAN FRANCISCO</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Reporters were lying in wait on the quay to
ask me what I thought about the General Strike.
I told them that I had been at sea for the last month
and was therefore entirely ignorant of current English
affairs. That made no difference, they assured
me; they wanted my opinion all the same. I gave
them my prejudices, which are Fabian and mildly
labourite. They thanked me, took some photographs
and departed. The photographs appeared
in the evening papers. They bore a certain resemblance
to the original. The camera cannot lie. Or,
to be more accurate, it can lie; but the process of
making it lie is tedious and expensive. The photographers
had no sufficient inducement to improve
my appearance. But the speech which accompanied
the pictures and which was attributed to
me, was beautifully unrecognisable. Such a paean
in praise of capitalism and Mr. Baldwin! It did
one’s heart good to read it. Labourism and Fabian
prejudices are not popular in America. The reporters
had made me respectable. It was meant,
no doubt, as an act of kindness. Still I should have
preferred it if they had emended my face rather
than my opinions.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>ON THE TRAIN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Daylight Limited takes just twelve hours
to run from San Francisco to Los Angeles.
And through what various landscapes!</p>

<p class='pindent'>First the English home counties—a land like a
park, checkered with small ploughed fields and
swelling into little hills. The little hills became
rolling downs, the downs grew larger and larger,
until they were great mountains with mile-high
slopes of grass and here and there a wood of dark
evergreen trees. The mountains subsided, the land
became dryer and more barren, the grass disappeared.
For an hour or two we were in a desert—miles
upon miles of dust, fledged sparsely with
the grey-leaved growth of a parched land. We
might have been in Rajputana. But there, suddenly,
on the right, was the Pacific, for ever breaking
and breaking on its desolate beaches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One hundred and thirteen miles along the
shores of the Ocean,” a gentleman in uniform
obligingly informed us, and then tried to sell us
tinted spectacles that we might contemplate the
Ocean without discomfort. “Sci-en-tifically made
to exclude the ultra-violet rays. The price is one
dollar only.” All day, at intervals of half an hour,
he walked up and down the train, telling us about
the beauties and the wealth of California and
peddling, now postcards, now candies, now Californian
figs and oranges, now chewing-gum and
True Story Magazines. He was the only distraction
on the train. In a desperation of <span class='it'>désœuvrement</span>
the passengers bought whatever he offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One hundred and thirteen miles along the
shores of the Ocean.” Before we had passed the
hundred and thirteenth milestone, the country had
changed again—had changed from the sea coast of
Rajputana to that of Italy. The deserts began to
flourish. Groves of lemons and oranges flanked
the railway. There were vineyards, and fields of
corn, and bright flowers. Parallel with the sea, a
range of elegant and florid mountains mimicked
the Apuan Alps. A little architecture, and the
illusion would have been complete. But there
were no churches, no huge pink villas among the
cypresses, no castles on the hills. Nothing but
wooden shanties and little brick dog kennels, dust
heaps and oil tanks and telegraph poles, and the
innumerable motor cars of the most prosperous
country in the world.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>LOS ANGELES. A RHAPSODY</h2>

<h3 class='nobreak'>First Movement</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Daylight had come to the common folk of
Hollywood, the bright Californian daylight.
But within the movie studio there shone no sun,
only the lamps, whose intense and greenish yellow
radiance gives to living men and women the appearance
of jaundiced corpses. In a corner of one
huge barn-like structure they were preparing to
“shoot.” The camera stood ready, the corpse-lights
were in full glare. Two or three cowboys
and a couple of clowns lounged about, smoking.
A man in evening dress was trusting to his moustache
to make him look like an English villain.
A young lady, so elegant, so perfectly and flawlessly
good-looking that you knew her at once for
the Star, was sitting in a corner, reading a book.
The Director—it seemed a waste that such a profile
should be <span class='it'>au-dessus de la mêlée</span> instead of in
the pictures—gave her a courteous hail. Miss X
looked up from her literature. “It’s the scene
where you see the murder being committed,” he
explained. Miss X got up, put away the book and
beckoned to her maid, who brought her a comb
and a mirror. “My nose all right?” she asked,
dabbing on powder. “Music!” shouted the Director.
“Make it emotional.” The band, whose duty
it is in every studio to play the actors into an appropriate
state of soul, struck up a waltz. The
studio was filled with a sea of melodic treacle; our
spirits rocked and wallowed on its sticky undulations.
Miss X handed back her powder puff to the
maid and walked up to the camera. “You hide behind
that curtain and look out,” the Director explained.
Miss X retired behind the curtain. “Just
the hand first of all,” the Director went on.
“Clutching. Then the face, gradually.” “Yes,
Mr. Z,” came the quiet voice of the Star from behind
the hanging plush. “Ready?” asked the Director.
“Then go ahead.” The camera began to
purr, like a genteel variety of dentist’s drill. The
curtain slightly heaved. A white hand clutched
at its edge. “Terror, Miss X,” called the Director.
The white hand tightened its clutch in a spasm of
cinematographic fear. The Director nodded to
the bandmaster. “Put some pep into it,” he adjured.
Pep was put in; the billows of treacle rose
higher. “Now the face, Miss X. Slowly. Just
one eye. That’s good. Hold it. A little more
terror.” Miss X heart-rendingly registered her
alarm. “That’s good. That’s very good. O.K.”
The camera stopped purring. Miss X came out
from behind the curtain and walked back to her
chair. Reopening her book, she went on quietly
reading about Theosophy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We moved on and, after halting for a few moments
on our way to watch some more terror being
registered (by a man this time and under a different
Director), penetrated into the secret places of
the studio. We pronounced passwords, quoted the
Manager’s permission, disclaimed connections with
rival companies and were finally admitted. In
one room they were concocting miracles and natural
cataclysms—typhoons in bathtubs and miniature
earthquakes, the Deluge, the Dividing of the
Red Sea, the Great War in terms of toy tanks and
Chinese fire crackers, ghosts and the Next World.
In another they were modelling prehistoric animals
and the architecture of the remote future.
In cellars below ground, mysteriously lighted by
red lamps and smelling of chemicals, a series of
machines was engaged in developing and printing
the films. Their output was enormous. I forget
how many thousands of feet of art and culture they
could turn out each day. Quite a number of miles,
in any case.</p>

<h3 class='nobreak'>Second Movement</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Emerging, I bought a newspaper. It was Saturday’s;
a whole page was filled with the announcements
of rival religious sects, advertising the spiritual
wares that they would give away, or sell on
the Sabbath. “Dr. Leon Tucker with the Musical
Messengers in a Great Bible Conference. 3 Meetings
To-morrow. Organ Chimes, Giant Marimbaphone,
Vibraphone, Violin, Piano, Accordeon,
Banjo, Guitar and other Instruments. Wilshire
Baptist Church.” The Giant Marimbaphone was
certainly tempting. But in the First Methodist
Church (Figueroa at Twentieth) they were going
to distribute “Mother’s Day Flowers to all Worshippers.”
(On Mother’s Day you must wear a
red carnation if your mother is alive, a white one
if she is dead. The florists are everywhere the
most ardent of matriolaters.) Moreover they had
booked the exclusive services of Dr. James H.
Maclaren, Dramatic Orator, who was going to
give his well-known stunt, “Impersonations of
Lincoln and Roosevelt.” “Dr. Maclaren,” we
were informed, “comes with a unique, original,
eloquent, instructive and inspiring Message concerning
two of our Great Presidents. Uplifting
and inspiring. It will do your soul good. The
wonderful Messages of these two Great Presidents
will be brought home with new emphasis and you
will feel that you have spent the evening in the
company of great Spirits. Hear the great organ,
Quartet of Artists and Vested Chorus.” At the
Hollywood Congregational Church there were to
be moving pictures of Jackie Coogan in his crusade
to the Near East; the prospect was a draw. But
then so was the photograph of Miss Leila Castberg
of the Church of Divine Power (Advanced
Thought); her performance might not be very interesting—she
was scheduled to preach at the
Morosco Theatre on Divine Motherhood—but the
face which looked out from her advertisement was
decidedly pleasing. Less attractive, to the devout
male at any rate, were the photos of Messrs. Clarke
and Van Bruch; but the phrasing of their ad. was
enough to counteract in the mind of the reader the
effect produced by their portraits. “<span class='sc'>It’s on,
folks, it’s on</span>,” so the announcement ran. “The
tide is rising at an <span class='sc'>old-fashioned revival</span>. Every
night except Monday, 7.30 <span class='sc'>p.m.</span> Soul-stirring sermons
and songs. Special to-night! Hear 10
Evangelists—10. Van Bruch-Clarke Evangelistic
Party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jazz it up, jazz it up. Keep moving. Step on
the gas. Say it with dancing. The Charleston,
the Baptists. Radios and Revivals. Uplift and
Gilda Gray. The pipe organ, the nigger with the
saxophone, the Giant Marimbaphone. Hymns and
the movies and Irving Berlin. Petting Parties and
the First Free United Episcopal Methodist
Church. Jazz it up! “N. C. Beskin, the <span class='sc'>converted
jew</span>, back from a successful tour, will conduct
a tabernacle campaign in Glendale. “<span class='sc'>Why
I became a christian?</span>” Dressed in Jewish garb.
Will exhibit interesting paraphernalia.” Positively
the last appearance. The celebrated Farmyard
Imitations. 10 Evangelists—10. The finest
troupe of Serio-Comic Cyclists ever. Onward
Christian Soldiers. Abide with me. I’m gonna
bring a watermelon to my girl to-night.</p>

<h3 class='nobreak'>Third Movement</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Mother’s Day. (Mr. Herring of Indiana, “The
Father of Mother’s Day.”) But why not Flapper’s
Day? It would be more representative, more
democratic, so to speak. For in Joy City there
are many more Flappers—married as well as unmarried—than
Mothers.</p>

<div class='literal-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>Nunc vitiat uterum quae vult formosa videri,</p>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>Thousands and thousands of flappers, and almost
all incredibly pretty. Plumply ravishing, they
give, as T. S. Eliot has phrased it, a “promise of
pneumatic bliss.” Of pneumatic bliss, but of not
much else, to judge by their faces. So curiously
uniform, unindividual and blank. Hardly more
expressive—to the foreign eye, at any rate—than
any of the other parts of that well-contoured anatomy
which they are at such pains to display.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the beaches of the Pacific that display was
indeed superb. Mack Sennett Bathing Beauties
by the hundred. They gambolled all around us,
as we walked up and down in the windy sunlight
along the sands. Frisking temptations. But we
were three St. Anthonies—Charlie Chaplin and
Robert Nichols and I—three grave theologians of
art, too deeply absorbed in discussing the way of
cinematographic salvation to be able to bestow
more than the most casual attention oh the Sirens,
however plumply deserving.</p>

<h3 class='nobreak'>Fourth Movement</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Cocktail time. (We’ve dealt with the same
bootlegger for upwards of two years now. A most
reliable man.). Ice rattles in the shaker—a dance
of miniature skeletons—and the genuinely reliable
liquor is poured out. <span class='it'>À boire, à boire!</span> Long
live Pantagruel! This is dry America. We
climbed into our host’s car and drove, it seemed
interminably, through the immense and sprawling
city. Past movie palaces and theatres and dance
halls. Past shining shops and apartments and
enormous hotels. On every building the vertical
lines of light went up like rockets into the dark
sky. And the buildings themselves—they too had
almost rocketed into existence. Thirty years ago
Los Angeles was a one-horse—a half-horse—town.
In 1940 or thereabouts it is scheduled to be as big
as Paris. As big and as gay. The great Joy City
of the West.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what joy! The joy of rushing about, of
always being busy, of having no time to think, of
being too rich to doubt. The joy of shouting and
bantering, of dancing and for ever dancing to the
noise of a savage music, of lustily singing.</p>

<p class='noindent'>The joy of loudly laughing and talking at the top
of the voice about nothing. (For thought is barred
in this City of Dreadful Joy and conversation is unknown.)
The joy of drinking prohibited whisky
from enormous silver flasks, the joy of cuddling
provocatively bold and pretty flappers, the joy of
painting the cheeks, of rolling the eye and showing
off the desirable calves and figure. The joy
of going to the movies and the theatre, of sitting
with one’s fellows in luxurious and unexclusive
clubs, of trooping out on summer evenings with
fifty thousand others to listen to concerts in the
open air, of being always in a crowd, never alone.
The joy of going on Sundays to hear a peppy
sermon, of melting at the hymns, of repenting one’s
sins, of getting a kick out of uplift. The joy in
a word, of having what is technically known as a
Good Time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And oh, how strenuously, how whole-heartedly
the people of Joy City devote themselves to having
a Good Time! The Good Times of Rome and
Babylon, of Byzantium and Alexandria were dull
and dim and miserably restricted in comparison
with the superlatively Good Time of modern
California. The ancient world was relatively
poor; and it had known catastrophe. The wealth
of Joy City is unprecedentedly enormous. Its
light-hearted people are unaware of War or pestilence
or famine or revolution, have never in their
safe and still half empty Eldorado known anything
but prosperous peace, contentment, universal acceptance.
The truest patriots, it may be, are those
who pray for a national calamity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On and on we drove, through the swarming
streets of Joy City. (One automobile, sir, to every
three and a quarter inhabitants.) The tall buildings
impended, the lights whizzed up like rockets.
On and on. Across an open space there suddenly
loomed up a large white building, magically shining
against the intensified blackness of the sky
behind. (Just finished, sir, The Temple of the
Elks.) From its summit the beams of half a dozen
searchlights waved to heaven. They seemed the
antennae of some vast animal, feeling and probing
in the void—for what? For Truth, perhaps?
Truth is not wanted in the City of Dreadful Joy.
For Happiness? It is possessed. For God? But
God had already been found; he was inside the
shining Temple; he <span class='it'>was</span> the temple, the brand
new, million-dollar Temple, in which at this
moment the initiates of the venerable Order of
Elks were congregated to worship, not the effetely
aristocratic Lady Poverty, but plain American
Mrs. Wealth. Five or six hundred motor cars
stood parked outside the doors. What <span class='it'>could</span> those
luminous antennae be probing for? Why, for
nothing, of course, for nothing! If they waved
so insistently, that was just for fun. Waving for
waving’s sake. Movement is a joy and this is the
great Joy City of the West.</p>

<h3 class='nobreak'>Fifth Movement</h3>

<p class='pindent'>The restaurant is immense. The waiters sprint
about, carrying huge dishes of the richest food.
What Gargantuan profusion! Great ten pound
chops, square feet of steak, fillets of whale, whole
turkeys stewed in cream, mountains of butter.
And the barbarous music throbs and caterwauls
unceasingly. Between each juicy and satiating
course, the flappers and the young men dance,
clasped in an amorous wrestle. How Rabelais
would have adored it! For a week, at any rate.
After that, I am afraid, he would have begun to
miss the conversation and the learning, which serve
in his Abbey of Thelema as the accompaniment
and justification of pleasure. This Western
pleasure, meaty and raw, untempered by any
mental sauce—would even Rabelais’s unsqueamish
stomach have been strong enough to digest it? I
doubt it. In the City of Dreadful Joy Pantagruel
would soon have died of fatigue and boredom.
<span class='it'>Taedium laudamus</span>—so reads (at any rate for the
inhabitants of Rabelais’s continent) the triumphant
canticle of Californian joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The restaurant is suddenly plunged into darkness.
A great beam of light, like the Eye of God
in an old engraving, stares down from somewhere
near the ceiling, right across the room, squinting
this way and that, searching—and at last finding
what it had been looking for; a radiant figure in
white, the singer of the evening. A good, though
not superlatively good singer in the style of Ethel
Levey or Jenny Golder.</p>

<p class='noindent'>And so on. The enthusiasm which greets these
rhymed lectures in elementary physiology is inordinate.
Being enthusiastic is a joy. We are in
Joy’s metropolis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a final burst of applause. The divine
eyelid closes down over God’s shining eye. The
band strikes up again. The dancing re-begins.
The Charleston, the fox-trot. “There is only one
first-class civilisation in the world to-day. It is
right here, in the United States and the Dominion
of Canada.” Monkeyville, Bryan, the Ku Klux
Klan. “Europe’s is hardly second-class, and Asia’s
is fourth to sixth class.” Jazz it up; jazz it up!
And what did late, great Ambassador Page have
to say? “The whole continent (of Europe) is
rotten, or tyrannical, or yellow dog. I wouldn’t
give Long Island or Moore County for the whole
continent of Europe.” And with Coney Island
added to Long Island and Los Angeles in the scale
along with Moore County, he might have thrown
in all Asia and the British Empire. Three cheers
for Page! Yes, sir, “American idealism has made
itself felt as a great contributory force to the advancement
of mankind.” Three cheers for George
F. Babbitt and the Rotary Club! And three cheers
for Professor Nixon Carver! “Prosperity,” the
Professor has said, “is coming to us precisely because
our ideas are not materialistic. All these
things (<span class='it'>e.g.</span>, the Elks’ Temple, the jazz bands, the
movie palaces, the muffins at breakfast) are added
to us precisely because we are seeking the Kingdom
of God and His righteousness.” Three cheers
more—thrice three! The Prof. deserves them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is almost midnight. A few minutes and it
will be the Sabbath. A few hours and the Giant
Marimbaphone will be proclaiming the glory of
the new billion dollar God. At the Ambassador

Ernest Holmes will be preaching on “The Science
of Jesus.” It is time to go home. Farewell, farewell.
Parting is such sweet sorrow. Did Tosti

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHICAGO</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Turning over the pages of the Chicago telephone
directory, I came upon a full-page
advertisement of a firm of undertakers, or “morticians,”
as they are now more elegantly styled in
America. The type was large and bold; my eye
was fatally caught. I interrupted my search to
read, in twenty lines of lyrical prose, an appreciation
of the incomparable Service which Kalbsfleisch
and Company were rendering to Society.
Their shop, I learned, was a mortuary chapel in
the Gothic style; their caskets (the grosser English
would call them coffins) were elegant, silk-lined
and cheap; their motor-hearses were funereally
sumptuous; their manners towards the bereaved
were grave, yet cheering, yet purposefully uplifting;
and they were fortunate in being able to
“lay the Loved Ones to rest in—graveyard, the
Cemetery Unusual.” Service was their motto
and always would be. Service whole-hearted and
unflagging. And to prove that they meant it, personally
and individually, they had reproduced two
photographs, one of Mr. Kalbsfleisch, the Governing
Director of the Firm, and the other of charming
Mrs. Kalbsfleisch, Licensed Embalmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I remained for some time in meditative contemplation
of Mrs. Kalbsfleisch’s smile; I re-read
more than once her husband’s poetical and uplifting
prose. The page on which I now gazed was
something more, I reflected, than a mere page of
advertising in a telephone book. It was a page out
of contemporary American history. Something is
happening on the Western shore of the Atlantic,
something that has already made America unlike
any other country in the world, something that
threatens to separate it still further from the older
civilisations, unless (which God forbid) the older
civilisations should themselves fall victims to the
same distorting process. To any one who reads
and inwardly digests Mr. Kalbsfleisch’s advertisement
in the Chicago telephone book, the nature of
this strange historical process becomes clear. The
page is a symptom and a revealing symbol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thing which is happening in America is a
revaluation of values, a radical alteration (for the
worse) of established standards. Mr. Kalbsfleisch
shows us how far the process has already gone.
How much farther it may go we cannot guess, nor
to what consummation it will lead, nor whether
there may be reactions and counter-processes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are two ways in which the existing standards
of value may be altered. In the first case, the
very existence of values may be denied. In the
second, values are admitted, but the mode in which
they are assigned is changed: things which in the
past had been regarded as possessing great value
are disparaged or, more often, things which were
previously considered of small value come to be
regarded as precious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Europe such attempts as have been made to
alter the existing standard of values have generally
taken the form of denials of the existence of values.
Our belief that things possess value is due to an
immediate sense or intuition; we feel, and feeling
we know, that things have value. If men have
doubted the real existence of values, that is because
they have not trusted their own immediate and
intuitive conviction. They have required an intellectual,
a logical and “scientific” proof of their
existence. Now such a proof is not easily found
at the best of times. But when you start your
argumentation from the premises laid down by
scientific materialism, it simply cannot be discovered.
Indeed, any argument starting from these
premises must infallibly end in a denial of the real
existence of values. Fortunately human beings are
capable of enormous inconsistencies, and the eighteenth-
and nineteenth-century men of science,
whose conception of the universe was such that
values could not be regarded by them as possessing
any sort of real existence, were in practice the most
ardent upholders of the established standards of
values.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still the materialist conception of the universe
could not fail to exert an influence. The generation
of Arnold and of Tennyson sat uncomfortably
on the horns of what seemed an unescapable
dilemma. Either the materialist hypothesis was
true; in which case there was no such thing as
value. Or else it was false; in which case values
really existed, but science could not. But science
manifestly <span class='it'>did</span> exist. The electric telegraph and
the steam engine were there to prove it. The fact
that you could go into any post office and communicate
almost instantaneously with the antipodes
was felt to be a confirmation of the materialistic
hypothesis then current among men of science. It
worked, therefore it was true, and therefore our
intimate sense of the existence of values was a mere
illusion. Tennyson and Arnold did not want it
to be an illusion; they were distressed, they were
inwardly divided. Their intellects denied what
their feelings asserted; and the Truth (or rather
what was at that time apparently the Truth) was
at war with their hopes, their intuitive convictions,
their desires. The European intellectuals of a
later generation accepted the conclusions logically
derivable from the scientific-materialist hypothesis
and resigned themselves—almost with glee—to
living in a devaluated world. Some of them are
still with us, and the theories which they propounded,
as corollaries to the main value-denying
theory from which they started, are still influential.
Claiming to speak as the apostles of scientific truth,
they stripped art of its significance, they reinterpreted
human life in terms, not of its highest,
spiritual aspects, but of its lowest. (I am using
the terms “highest” and “lowest,” which they, of
course, would repudiate as nonsensical.) A less
sophisticated generation had regarded the Sistine
frescoes as being somehow superior to a prettily
patterned rug, <span class='it'>Macbeth</span> as more important than
<span class='it'>The Rape of the Lock</span>. Illusion! According to
the apostles of scientific truth, one was really just
as good as the other. Indeed, the <span class='it'>Rape</span> and the
patterned rug were actually superior to <span class='it'>Macbeth</span>
and the Michelangelo frescoes, as being more finished
and perfect works of art: they aroused, it was
explained, intenser “aesthetic emotions.” Art thus
satisfactorily disposed of, religion was next “explained”
in terms of sex. The moral conscience
was abolished (another illusion) and “amuse yourself”
proclaimed as the sole categorical imperative.
The theories of Freud were received in intellectual
circles with acclaim; to explain every
higher activity of the human mind in terms of incest
and coprophily came to be regarded not only
as truly scientific, but also as somehow virile and
courageous. Freudism became the <span class='it'>realpolitik</span> of
psychology and philosophy. Those who denied
values felt themselves to be rather heroic; instinctively
they were appealing to the standards which
they were trying, intellectually, to destroy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the men of science are finding that
the crude materialism of their predecessors is a
hypothesis that will not work. Our apostles of
scientific truth find themselves the apostles of what
will soon be universally regarded as a fallacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the influence of these <span class='it'>ci-devant</span> “scientific”
deniers of value has not been wide. In most human
beings the intuitive sense of values is too strong
to be seriously affected by intellectual arguments,
however specious. They are revolted by the denial
of values; they insist on interpreting the world in
terms of high and low. Unfortunately, however,
they are apt to make mistakes and to call things by
the wrong names, labelling “high” what should
rightly be low, and “low” what ought to be high.
This falsification of the standard of values is a
product, in our modern world, of democracy, and
has gone farthest in America. It is much more
dangerous than the mere denial of values, because
it is much more popular. To most men and women
the denial of values is horrible; but the falsification
of them so as to square with democratic prejudices
is pleasant and flattering. Let us examine Mr.
Kalbsfleisch’s advertisement and try to discover
the direction in which standards have been perverted
and the methods of falsification employed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The democratic hypothesis in its extreme and
most popular form is that all men are equal and
that I am just as good as you are. It is so manifestly
untrue that a most elaborate system of humbug
has had to be invented in order to render it
credible to any normally sane human being. Nowhere
has this system of humbug been brought to
such perfection as in America. Take the case of
Mr. Kalbsfleisch. He is an undertaker. The trade
he practises has never enjoyed great esteem; for,
although it is a necessary trade, it cannot be said
to call for high intellectual or moral qualities in its
practitioners. Mr. Kalbsfleisch and his fellows
have realised and resented this failure on the part
of humanity to esteem them. Being good democrats,
they want to insist on their equality with the
admittedly best people. They begin by altering
the name of their trade. The word “undertaker”
has base associations. They therefore coin a new
locution and style themselves “morticians.” “Mortician”
is a word that rhymes with such highly
reputable words as physician, mathematician,
academician, politician—not to mention Titian.
What’s in a name? Much. From having been
undertakers and mere tradesmen, the morticians
have become artists and members of an almost
learned profession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having emended their name, the morticians proceed
to exalt and magnify their calling. They
do this in a very simple, but eminently effective
way: by insisting on the Service which they render
to Humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The notion of Service is fundamental to Christianity.
Jesus and his greatest followers have proclaimed
the spiritual importance of Service and
have exhorted all men and women to be the servants
of their fellows. The morticians, and with
them all the Business Men of America, are as
whole-heartedly enthusiastic about Service as was
ever St. Francis or his divine Master. But the
activities which they designate by the word “Service”
happen to be slightly different from those
which the Founder of Christianity called by the
same name. For Jesus and St. Francis, Service
connoted self-sacrifice, abnegation, humility. For
the morticians and other American Business Men,
Service means something else; it means doing
profitable business efficiently and with just sufficient
honesty to keep out of jail. American Business
Men talk like St. Francis; but their activities
are indistinguishable from those of the money-changers
and the sellers of doves whom Jesus expelled
from the Temple with a whip of small
cords.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The money-changers and the bird-hawkers protested,
no doubt, that they were serving humanity
as well as, and even better than, their aggressor.
“What we do,” they must have argued, “is useful
and necessary; society finds us indispensable.” It
is on the same ground—that they perform necessary
jobs well—that American Business Men claim
to be doing Service, and Service of the highest
value. They overlook the significant historical fact
that all the valuable things in life, all the things
that make for civilisation and progress, are precisely
the unnecessary ones. All scientific research,
all art, all religion are (by comparison with making
coffins or breakfast foods) unnecessary. But if
we had stuck to the merely necessary, we should
still be apes. According to any proper standard of
values, the unnecessary things and the unnecessary
people who are concerned with them are much
more important than the necessary ones. By exalting
the merely necessary to an equality with the
unnecessary, the American Business Man has falsified
the standard of values. The service rendered
by a mortician or a realtor has come to be regarded
as the equivalent of the service rendered by an
artist of a man of science. Babbitt can now honestly
believe that he and his kind are doing as
much for humanity as the Pasteurs and the Isaac
Newtons. Kalbsfleisch among his silk-lined caskets
knows himself to be as good as Beethoven. Successful
stockbrokers, certain that Business is Religion,
can come home after a day of speculation
on the Exchange, feeling as virtuously happy as
Buddha must have felt when he had renounced
the world and received his great illumination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In every part of the world and at all times the
vast majority of human beings has consisted of
Babbitts and peasants. They are indispensable;
the necessary work must be done. But never, except
at the present time, and nowhere but in America,
have the necessary millions believed themselves
the equals of the unnecessary few. In Europe the
ancient standards still persist, the ghost at least of
the old hierarchy survives. The rich parvenu may
despise the man of science for his poverty; but he
still feels humble before his knowledge, his superior
intelligence and his disinterestedness. That
technique of humbug, by the employment of which
successful stockbroking may be made to seem as
valuable and noble an occupation as scientific research
or artistic creation, has not yet been perfected
in Europe, it has hardly been invented.
True, there are many people who would like to
see the technique introduced, ready-made and perfected,
from across the Atlantic. I trust, and I am
even moderately confident, that they will be for
ever disappointed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, on the Western side of the Atlantic
the progressive falsification of values steadily continues.
So far, what has happened is this: preciousness
has been attributed to things and people
previously regarded as possessing small value. But
in certain parts of the Union the innumerable necessary
men are preparing to move a step farther.
Not content with attributing the highest possible
value to themselves, they are denying it to the unnecessary
few; the majority has sovereign rights.
What was previously held to be high is now being
disparaged. The mental and moral qualities, the
occupations and diversions of the greatest number
are regarded as the best, the sole permissible; the
qualities and occupations of the few are condemned.
Stupidity, suggestibility and business
are held up as supremely precious. Intelligence,
independence and disinterested activity—once admired—are
in process of becoming evil things
which ought to be destroyed. In Tennessee and
other remote provinces the crusade against them
has already begun. It remains to be seen whether
this further perversion of values will affect the
rest of the continent.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>NEW YORK</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Now that liberty is out-of-date, equality an exploded
notion and fraternity a proven impossibility,
republics should change their mottoes. Intelligence,
Sterility, Insolvency: that would do for
contemporary France. But not for America. The
American slogan would have to be something quite
different. The national motto should fit the national
facts. What I should write under America’s
flapping eagle would be: Vitality, Prosperity,
Modernity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us begin with the last, modernity. Modernity
in this context may be defined as the freedom
(at any rate in the sphere of practical, material
life) from customary bonds and ancient prejudices,
from traditional and vested interest; the freedom,
in a word, from history. Change is accepted in
America as the first and fundamental fact—and
accepted, not as other peoples have accepted it, as
an evil to be combated by the organisation of a
stable society, by the making of things too strong
and solid for time to be able quickly to devour, but
as a good, as the foundation and key of practical
life. Most things in this modern land are provisional,
made to last only till something better, or
at any rate something newer, shall appear to take
their place. All through the country the houses
have an air of impermanence; the landscape, wherever
the hand of man has touched it, looks sketchy
and unfinished. The factories are perpetually renewing
themselves; half their profits are ear-marked
for the expenses of this chronic rejuvenation.
Forty-year old locomotives, having the
strange and almost fabulous aspect of Tertiary
monsters, still rumble over European rails. A respectable
American railway company would think
itself disgraced by the possession of an engine that
was more than ten years of age. Nor would the
engines survive much longer; things, here, are
built to be scrapped as soon as they have outworn
their first youth. Change is made much of, it is
rejoiced in. That is modernity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then there is prosperity. America is a half-populated
country teeming with natural wealth.
Business methods are unhampered, except perhaps
in the East, by the old traditions belonging to a
vanished form of society. The traditions of an age
of feudalism, of agriculture and of craftsmanship
have done much to cramp the efficient and rational
development of industrialism in Europe. The
greater part of America started with a clean slate.
In California there is one motor car to every three
inhabitants. Considering the Californian circumstances,
it is not to be wondered at.</p>

<p class='pindent'>American vitality is a function, mathematically
speaking, of the prosperity and the modernity. An
insufficiently nourished human being requires a
great deal of rest. Reduced to an Indian diet,
Americans would be a good deal less interested
than they actually are in business efficiency, uplift
and the Charleston. They would spend most of
their spare time in doze, or in the doze’s first
cousin: meditation. But they have enough to eat—a
great deal more than enough, in fact. They can
afford to hustle; indeed they must hustle or else
die of plethora. Men and women who wash down
beefsteaks with glasses of rich creamy milk need to
do something pretty strenuous in order to keep
alive at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The psychological effects of prosperity are
hardly less striking than the physical. In less
fortunate countries the precariousness of existence
keeps large classes of the population in a state of
chronic fear. Unemployment is a haunting apprehension,
both to manual workers and to those
who wear black coats. So little is needed in Europe
to precipitate the man of the middle class into
the abysses of lower classdom; the bottomless pit
of poverty, into which so many of the manual
workers have already fallen, gapes before his feet.
Fear haunts and for ever darkly impends. Fear
is the enemy of life; it inhibits every function of
the mind and body. That is why, in the less fortunate
parts of Europe, vitality is so low.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In America this fear hardly exists; there is no
reason why any one should fail to earn good wages.
Nor is the fall from the status of the clerk to that,
shall we say, of the factory hand discreditable, as
it would be in the older countries, where the prejudice
against manual labour as something fundamentally
degrading and unrespectable still lingers.
The middle classes are therefore largely relieved
of their terror of losing caste. Liberated from fear,
the Americans live with confidence, and therefore
with enhanced vitality. A generous extravagance,
undreamed of in other parts of the world, is the
American rule. Men and women earn largely and
spend what they have on the national pleasures,
which are all social and stimulative of vitality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Modernity also tends to heighten vitality—or to
be more exact, it affects the expression of vitality,
externalising it in the form of vehement action.
The joyful acceptance of change, which so profoundly
influences American industry, business
methods and domestic architecture, reacts on the
affairs of daily, personal life. Pleasure is associated
with a change of place and environment,
finally with mere movement for its own sake. People
leave their homes if they want entertainment.
They externalise their vitality in visiting places of
public amusement, in dancing and motoring—in
doing anything that is not quietly sitting by their
own fireside (or rather by their own radiator).
What is known as “night life” flourishes in America
as nowhere else in the world. And nowhere,
perhaps, is there so little conversation. In America
vitality is given its most obviously vital expression.
Hence there appears to be even more vitality
in the Americans than perhaps there really is. A
man may have plenty of vitality and yet keep still;
his motionless calm may be mistaken for listlessness.
There can be no mistake about people who
dance and rush about. American vitality is always
obviously manifested. It expresses itself vigorously
to the music of the drum and saxophone,
to the ringing of telephone bells and the roar of
street cars. It expresses itself in terms of hastening
automobiles, of huge and yelling crowds, of
speeches, banquets, “drives,” slogans, sky signs. It
is all movement and noise, like the water gurgling
out of a bath—down the waste. Yes, down the
waste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>America is popularly supposed to be a country
of puritanism. And so it is, as any one who travels
across it can discover. But what the traveller also
discovers—to his vast surprise, if he happens to
have arrived with conventional opinions about the
country—is that a Rabelaisian looseness is just as
characteristic of contemporary America as puritanical
strictness. In Philadelphia the respectable
booksellers do not stock Mr. Cabell’s <span class='it'>Jurgen</span>. In
Boston the Watch and Ward Society suppresses
the <span class='it'>American Mercury</span>, and in the same city one at
least of my own novels has to be sold under the
counter as though it were whisky. I have been
in Middle Western hotels where it was considered
indecent for my wife to smoke a cigarette in the
public rooms. And though I have not visited the
Southern States, I have read in the newspapers the
most extraordinary accounts of the persecutions to
which unfaithful wives and errant husbands are
liable there. It would be possible to quote many
other examples of American puritanism. The list
would be long and curious. These few specimens,
however, are sufficient to prove the old contention
that America is a puritanical country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is also and simultaneously one of the least
puritanical countries I have ever visited. In the
theatres of New York it is possible to see plays of a
character which can hardly be paralleled in any
other city of the world. I do not speak of the displays
of naked women; these have now become
too commonplace to be remarked on—except, perhaps,
in a country colonised by the Pilgrim
Fathers. And in any case, Puritans tolerate spectacles
and actions much more willingly than they
tolerate words. It is only during the last few
months that the Lord Chamberlain of England has
finally brought himself to license the public performance
of Bernard Shaw’s play, <span class='it'>Mrs. Warren’s
Profession</span>. Countless performances, whose appeal
was frankly pornographic, have been licensed
during the quarter-century of Mrs. Warren’s exile
from the stage. Shaw’s crime was to have discussed
frankly and seriously the subject of prostitution.
He broached certain ideas, used certain
words. Puritans like to wear the fig leaf over the
mouth. This puritanical idiosyncrasy renders all
the more remarkable the verbal frankness of many
of the plays current in New York during the past
months—plays in which there was no exposure of
skin, but where spades were openly called spades,
and often worse, more intimate names. I remember,
for example, a play called <span class='it'>Cradle Snatchers</span>.
It was a Restoration comedy brought up to date—Wycherley
without the wit. Indeed, it was a
little more than Restoration. Its theme, which
concerns three middle-aged ladies, who hire three
young men as lovers, is very close to that of a
comedy of Fletcher’s, <span class='it'>The Custom of the Country</span>,
which Dryden, when defending the Restoration
Theatre against the attacks of Jeremy Collier, pronounced
to be far more indecent than any play
written in his own day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was this play an isolated phenomenon. <span class='it'>Sex</span>
lived up to its simple name. <span class='it'>Lulu Belle</span> and <span class='it'>The
Shanghai Gesture</span> were no less remarkable. The
fruitiest passage in <span class='it'>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</span>,
which was playing when I passed through Chicago,
had a robustly Rabelaisian humour, which I
for one enormously enjoyed. But what did Mr.
Sumner of the New York Vice Society think of
those Gargantuan jokes? What about chaste Mr.
Chase from Boston? And what would have been
the reaction of those two lineal descendants of the
Pilgrim Fathers to the casual, light-hearted references
to homosexuality which I heard at more than
one burlesque show and cabaret? I wonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not alone in the theatre that this spirit of
anti-puritanism exhibits itself; it is also in American
life. In one part of the country cigarette
smoking will be forbidden, and the self-appointed
censors of public morality will hold up passing
automobiles and demand to see the marriage certificates
of their occupants. In another the relations
of the sexes will be easy, intimate and (how
shall I phrase it?) chronically amorous. Fresh
from the conventionalities and decorum of Paris
and London, the stranger coming to the West Coast
will be astonished by the amount of casual embracement,
squeezing and public kissing which he
sees going on, among the most respectable members
of society, in restaurants and dancing-places. He
will be astonished by the frankness with which
people discuss their intimate affairs—in voices,
moreover, so loud that the most private details are
reverberatingly audible for yards around. He will
be impressed by the almost Congolese style of
dancing, while that general atmosphere of hilarious
inebriation which pervades the night life of
all American cities will make him wonder whether
a little less Prohibition—which means a little less
whisky—might not perhaps be a good thing. In
modern America the Rome of Cato and the Rome
of Heliogabalus co-exist and flourish with an unprecedented
vitality.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>LONDON</h2>

<p class='pindent'>So the journey is over and I am back again where
I started, richer by much experience and poorer
by many exploded convictions, many perished certainties.
For convictions and certainties are too
often the concomitants of ignorance. Of knowledge
and experience the fruit is generally doubt.
It is a doubt that grows profounder as knowledge
more deeply burrows into the underlying mystery,
that spreads in exact proportion as experience is
widened and the perceptions of the experiencing
individual are refined. A fish’s convictions, we
may be sure, are unshakeable. A dog is as full of
certainty as the Veteran Liberal who has held the
same opinions for forty years. You might implore
a cat, as Cromwell by the bowels of Christ once
implored a parliament, to bethink it that it might
be mistaken; the beast would never doubt but that
it was right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I set out on my travels knowing, or thinking that
I knew, how men should live, how be governed,
how educated, what they should believe. I knew
which was the best form of social organisation and
to what end societies had been created. I had my
views on every activity of human life. Now, on
my return, I find myself without any of these pleasing
certainties. Before I started, you could have
asked me almost any question about the human
species and I should glibly have returned an answer.
Ask a profoundly ignorant man how the
electric light works; he finds the question absurdly
simple. “You just press the button,” he explains.
The working electrician would give you a rather
more technical account of the matter in terms of
currents, resistances, conductivity. But the philosophical
physicist would modestly confess his
ignorance. Electrical phenomena, he would say,
can be described and classified. But as for saying
what electricity may be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And he would throw
up his hands. The better you understand the significance
of any question, the more difficult it becomes
to answer it. Those who like to feel that
they are always right and who attach a high importance
to their own opinions should stay at home.
When one is travelling, convictions are mislaid
as easily as spectacles; but unlike spectacles, they
are not easily replaced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My own losses, as I have said, were numerous.
But in compensation for what I lost, I acquired
two important new convictions: that it takes all
sorts to make a world and that the established
spiritual values are fundamentally correct and
should be maintained. I call these opinions “new,”
though both are at least as old as civilisation and
though I was fully convinced of their truth before
I started. But truths the most ancient, the most
habitually believed, may be endowed for us as the
result of new experience with an appearance of
apocalyptic novelty. There is all the difference in
the world between believing academically, with
the intellect, and believing personally, intimately,
with the whole living self. A deaf man
who had read a book about music might be convinced,
theoretically, that Mozart was a good composer.
But cure his deafness, take him to listen to
the G minor Symphony; his conviction of Mozart’s
greatness would become something altogether new.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the fact that it takes all sorts to make a world
I have been aware ever since I could read. But
proverbs are always platitudes until you have personally
experienced the truth of them. The newly
arrested thief knows that honesty is the best policy
with an intensity of conviction which the rest of us
can never experience. And to realise that it takes
all sorts to make a world one must have seen a
certain number of the sorts with one’s own eyes.
Having seen them and having in this way acquired
an intimate realisation of the truth of the proverb,
one finds it hard to go on complacently believing
that one’s own opinions, one’s own way of life are
alone rational and right. This conviction of man’s
diversity must find its moral expression in the practice
of the completest possible tolerance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if travel brings a conviction of human diversity,
it brings an equally strong conviction of
human unity. It inculcates tolerance, but it also
shows what are the limits of possible toleration.
Religions and moral codes, forms of government
and of society are almost endlessly varied, and each
has a right to its separate existence. But a oneness
underlies this diversity. All men, whatever their
beliefs, their habits, their way of life, have a sense
of values. And the values are everywhere and in
all kinds of society broadly the same. Goodness,
beauty, wisdom and knowledge, with the human
possessors of these qualities, the human creators of
things and thoughts endowed with them, have always
and everywhere been honoured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our sense of values is intuitive. There is no
proving the real existence of values in any way
that will satisfy the logical intellect. Our standards
can be demolished by argumentation; but we
are none the less right to cling to them. Not
blindly, of course, not uncritically. Convinced by
practical experience of man’s diversity, the traveller
will not be tempted to cling to his own inherited
national standard, as though it were necessarily
the only true and unperverted one. He will
compare standards; he will search for what is common
to all; he will observe the ways in which each
standard is perverted, he will try to create a standard
of his own that shall be as far as possible free
from distortion. In one country, he will perceive,
the true, fundamental standard is distorted by an
excessive emphasising of hierarchic and aristocratic
principles; in another by an excess of democracy.
Here, too much is made of work and energy
for their own sakes; there, too much of mere being.
In certain parts of the world he will find spirituality
run wild; in others a stupid materialism that
would deny the very existence of values. The
traveller will observe these various distortions and
will create for himself a standard that shall be,
as far as possible, free from them—a standard
of values that shall be as timeless, as uncontingent
on circumstances, as nearly absolute as he can make
them. Understanding diversity and allowing for
it, he will tolerate, but not without limit. He will
distinguish between harmless perversions and those
which tend actually to deny or stultify the fundamental
values. Towards the first he will be tolerant.
There can be no compromise with the second.</p>
